(0,-1): Error: Unsupported Invalid Operation: Error: In the class ExternalClassContainer.ExternalPartialClass, some proper methods of crate::ExternalClassContainer::GetValueHolder are marked {:extern} and some are not. For the Rust compiler, please make all methods (GetValue, GetValue2)  bodiless and mark as {:extern} and implement them in a Rust file, or mark none of them as {:extern} and implement them in Dafny. Alternatively, you can insert an intermediate trait that performs the partial implementation if feasible.
