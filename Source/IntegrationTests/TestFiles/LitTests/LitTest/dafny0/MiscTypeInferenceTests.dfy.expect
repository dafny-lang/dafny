MiscTypeInferenceTests.dfy(85,11): Warning: the type of the other operand is a non-null type, so this comparison with 'null' will always return 'false' (to make it possible for variable 'x' to have the value 'null', declare its type to be 'Node?')
MiscTypeInferenceTests.dfy(95,16): Warning: the type of the other operand is a set of non-null elements, so the non-inclusion test of 'null' will always return 'true'
MiscTypeInferenceTests.dfy(14,59): Error: value does not satisfy the subset constraints of 'neg'
MiscTypeInferenceTests.dfy(24,11): Error: value does not satisfy the subset constraints of 'int -> int' (possible cause: it may be partial or have read effects)
MiscTypeInferenceTests.dfy(27,11): Error: value of expression (of type 'int -> int') is not known to be an instance of type 'int ~> nat'
MiscTypeInferenceTests.dfy(50,4): Error: assertion might not hold
MiscTypeInferenceTests.dfy(50,13): Error: function precondition could not be proved
MiscTypeInferenceTests.dfy(109,18): Error: cannot establish the existence of LHS values that satisfy the such-that predicate. Note, no trigger was found for the such-that predicate, which may be the reason the proof failed. To give a trigger explicitly, use the {:trigger} attribute. For more information, see the section on quantifier instantiation rules in the reference manual.
