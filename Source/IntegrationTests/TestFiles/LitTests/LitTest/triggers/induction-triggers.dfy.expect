induction-triggers.dfy(28,19): Warning: Could not find a trigger for the induction hypothesis. Without a trigger, this may cause brittle verification. Change or remove the {:induction} attribute to generate a different induction hypothesis, or add {:nowarn} to silence this warning. For more information, see the section on quantifier instantiation rules in the reference manual.
