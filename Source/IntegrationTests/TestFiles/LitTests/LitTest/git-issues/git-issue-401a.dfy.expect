CLI: Error: Z3 not found at Output/binz/z3. Please either provide a path to the `z3` executable using the `--solver-path <path>` option, manually place the `z3` directory next to the `dafny` executable you are using (this directory should contain `bin/z3-4.12.1` or `bin/z3-4.12.1.exe`), or set the PATH environment variable to also include a directory containing the `z3` executable.
