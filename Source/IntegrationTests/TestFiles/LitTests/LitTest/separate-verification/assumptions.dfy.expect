TestAuditor.dfy(45,17): Warning: when a method is imported, meaning it has no body and an {:extern} annotation, Dafny can not guarantee that its implementation satisfies its post-conditions (its ensures clauses and outputs that are subset types). To silence this warning, please add an {:axiom} attribute or use the option '--allow-external-contracts'.

To silence this warning, please add an {:axiom} attribute or use the option '--allow-external-contracts'
