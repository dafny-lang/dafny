In contrast to the let expression (`:=`), which allows multiple parallel initializations, 
the let-or-fail expression (`:-`) is implemented to
only allow at most a single left-hand-side and exactly one right-hand-side.

    Add(ErrorId.p_set_comprehension_needs_term_expression,
    @"
A set comprehension (1) declares one or more variables, (2) possibly states some limits on those variables, 
and (3) states an expression over those variables that are the values in the set.

If there is no expression, then the expression is taken to be just the _one_ declared variable.
For instance one could write `set b: bool`, which is equivalent to `set b: bool :: b` and would be the set of all `bool` values.
Another example is `set x: nat | x < 5, which is equivalent to `set x: nat | x < 5:: x` and would be the set `{0, 1, 2, 3, 4}`.

But if more than one variable is declared, then there is no natural implicit expression to fill in after the `::` if it is omitted, 
so some expression is required. The failing example above, for example, might use the expression `x * y`, as in 
`set x, y  | 0 <= x < y < 10 :: x * y`, or any other expression over `x` and `y`.

This ""invalid something"" message where the something is typically
the name of an internal parser non-terminal means that the text being parsed
is a badly malformed instance of whatever parser entity was being parsed.
This is an automatically generated message by the CoCo parser generator
for a situation in which no specific recovery or a
more informative error message has been implemented.

The only advice we can give is to carefully scrutinize the location of the
error to see what might be wrong with the text. If you think this is a
common or confusing enough occurrence to warrant special error handling,
please suggest the improvement, with this sample code, to the Dafny team.
