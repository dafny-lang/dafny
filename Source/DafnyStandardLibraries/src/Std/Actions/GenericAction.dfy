module Std.GenericActions {

  import opened Termination

  // A trait to express any imperative action in Dafny.
  // This is essentially a reflective interface for a method,
  // with all possible specifications attached.
  // It can also be thought of as the logical last step
  // in the progression of arrow types,
  // from the total, heap-independent ->,
  // to the partial but still heap-independent -->,
  // to the heap-reading ~>.
  // A generic action is thus like a function that can also modify the heap.
  //
  // (The behavior of a generic action may also be non-deterministic,
  // but this case seems less useful in practice,
  // so the definition of a MostlyGenericAction
  // that may only modify the heap deterministically
  // is left as an invitation to the sufficiently motivated Dafny contributor!)
  //
  // The more specific Action trait can be much more pleasant to use
  // when composing non-interferring actions together,
  // such as working with enumerators or streams,
  // as they make simplifying assumptions that are true for many reusable actions.
  // However, this more general action may be more flexible
  // when accepting any kind of callback in a higher-order method.
