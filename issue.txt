DAFNY RUST BACKEND COMPILATION ISSUE - AGENT BRIEFING

PROBLEM:
Dafny 4.11+ generates Rust code that fails to compile with type inference errors when using nested set comprehensions. The issue was introduced by PR #6143 which added LambdaWrapRc functionality.

REPRODUCTION:
1. Create file Scratch.dfy with content:
   ```
   const SomeMaps := {map["a" := "b"]}
   const OhNo := set x <- (set m <- SomeMaps :: m) :: x
   ```

2. Use the BUILT Dafny executable (NOT system dafny command):
   ```
   cd /local/home/mimayere/dafny
   ./Binaries/Dafny build -t:rs Scratch.dfy --enforce-determinism
   cd Scratch-rust
   cargo build
   ```

3. This produces compilation error:
   ```
   error[E0282]: type annotations needed
   --> src/Scratch.rs:39:36
   |
   39 | ...                   }))()).iter().cloned() {
   |                              ^^^^ cannot infer type
   ```

ROOT CAUSE:
The issue occurs because:
1. Set comprehensions are processed by SinglePassCodeGenerator.Expression.cs which creates IIFE (Immediately Invoked Function Expression) patterns
2. These generate DAST.Lambda expressions via DafnyCodeGenerator.CreateIIFE0()
3. The Dafny-written Rust compiler (Dafny-compiler-rust.dfy) processes these lambdas
4. The Lambda case (line 4218) calls LambdaWrapRc() which adds trait casts like:
   ```rust
   }) as Rc<dyn ::std::ops::Fn() -> _>
   ```
5. These trait casts obscure type information needed for Rust's `.iter().cloned()` type inference

KEY FILES:
- Source/DafnyCore/Backends/Rust/Dafny-compiler-rust.dfy (LambdaWrapRc method at line 3484)
- Source/DafnyCore/Backends/SinglePassCodeGenerator/SinglePassCodeGenerator.Expression.cs (SetComprehension case)
- Source/DafnyCore/Backends/Dafny/DafnyCodeGenerator.cs (CreateIIFE0 method)

CURRENT STATE:
- Issue reproduced successfully using ./Binaries/Dafny (commit f3b6788bc)
- Generated code contains the problematic trait casts
- Manual removal of trait casts fixes compilation
- The --rust-sync flag affects whether Rc or Arc is used but doesn't prevent the issue

SOLUTION NEEDED:
Modify the Rust code generation to avoid trait casts that break type inference in nested lambda scenarios, specifically in the LambdaWrapRc method or its callers.

IMPORTANT: Always use ./Binaries/Dafny executable, not the system dafny command, as the system command points to version 4.10 regardless of the current checkout.
