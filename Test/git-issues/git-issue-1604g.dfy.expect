git-issue-1604g.dfy(38,8): Error: Could not prove that the range constrains the bound variable 'f' to be of type SpecialFruit, and since SpecialFruit is a ghost subset type, no runtime type filter can be added on the collection whose elements have the type Fruit.
git-issue-1604g.dfy(16,31): [Related location] SpecialFruit is ghost because a call to a ghost predicate is allowed only in specification contexts (consider declaring the predicate with 'predicate method')
git-issue-1604g.dfy(38,40): Error: function precondition might not hold. Careful: variable f has type Fruit and not SpecialFruit because the range is compiled and SpecialFruit cannot be tested at run-time
