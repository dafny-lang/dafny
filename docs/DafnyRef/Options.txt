  ---- Dafny options ---------------------------------------------------------

  Multiple .dfy files supplied on the command line are concatenated into one
  Dafny program.

  /dprelude:<file>
                choose Dafny prelude file
  /dprint:<file>
                print Dafny program after parsing it
                (use - as <file> to print to console)
  /printMode:<Everything|DllEmbed|NoIncludes|NoGhost>
                Everything is the default.
                DllEmbed prints the source that will be included in a compiled dll.
                NoIncludes disables printing of {:verify false} methods incorporated via the
                include mechanism, as well as datatypes and fields included from other files.
                NoGhost disables printing of functions, ghost methods, and proof statements in
                implementation methods.  It also disables anything NoIncludes disables.
  /rprint:<file>
                print Dafny program after resolving it
                (use - as <file> to print to console)
  /titrace      print type-inference debug info
  /view:<view1, view2>
                print the filtered views of a module after it is resolved (/rprint).
                if print before the module is resolved (/dprint), then everthing in the module is printed
                if no view is specified, then everything in the module is printed. 
                
  /dafnyVerify:<n>
                0 - stop after typechecking
                1 - continue on to translation, verification, and compilation
  /compile:<n>  0 - do not compile Dafny program
                1 (default) - upon successful verification of the Dafny
                    program, compile Dafny program to .NET assembly
                    Program.exe (if the program has a Main method) or
                    Program.dll (othewise), where Program.dfy is the name
                    of the last .dfy file on the command line
                2 - always attempt to compile Dafny program to C# program
                    out.cs, regardless of verification outcome
                3 - if there is a Main method and there are no verification
                    errors, compiles program in memory (i.e., does not write
                    an output file) and runs it
                4 - like (3), but attempts to compile and run regardless of
                    verification outcome
  /compileTarget:<lang>
                cs (default) - Compilation to .NET via C#
                go - Compilation to Go
                js - Compilation to JavaScript
  /compileVerbose:<n>
                0 - don't print status of compilation to the console
                1 (default) - print information such as files being written by
                    the compiler to the console
  /spillTargetCode:<n>
                0 (default) - don't write the compiled Dafny program (but
                    still compile it, if /compile indicates to do so)
                1 - write the compiled Dafny program as a .cs file, if it
                    is being compiled
                2 - write the compiled Dafny program as a .cs file, provided
                    it passes the verifier, regardless of /compile setting
                3 - write the compiled Dafny program as a .cs file, regardless
                    of verification outcome and /compile setting
                NOTE: If there are .cs or .dll files on the command line, then
                the compiled Dafny program will also be written. More precisely,
                such files on the command line implies /spillTargetCode:1 (or
                higher, if manually specified).
  /out:<file>
                filename and location for the generated .cs, .dll or .exe files 
  /dafnycc      Disable features not supported by DafnyCC
  /noCheating:<n>
                0 (default) - allow assume statements and free invariants
                1 - treat all assumptions as asserts, and drop free.
  /induction:<n>
                0 - never do induction, not even when attributes request it
                1 - only apply induction when attributes request it
                2 - apply induction as requested (by attributes) and also
                    for heuristically chosen quantifiers
                3 (default) - apply induction as requested, and for
                    heuristically chosen quantifiers and lemmas
  /inductionHeuristic:<n>
                0 - least discriminating induction heuristic (that is, lean
                    toward applying induction more often)
                1,2,3,4,5 - levels in between, ordered as follows as far as
                    how discriminating they are:  0 < 1 < 2 < (3,4) < 5 < 6
                6 (default) - most discriminating
  /noIncludes   Ignore include directives
  /noExterns    Ignore extern and dllimport attributes
  /noNLarith    Reduce Z3's knowledge of non-linear arithmetic (*,/,%).
                Results in more manual work, but also produces more predictable behavior.
                (This switch will perhaps be replaced by /arith in the future.
                For now, it takes precedence of /arith.)
  /arith:<n>    (Experimental switch. Its options may change.)
                0 - Use Boogie/Z3 built-ins for all arithmetic operations.
                1 (default) - Like 0, but introduce symbolic synonyms for *,/,%, and
                    allow these operators to be used in triggers.
                2 - Like 1, but introduce symbolic synonyms also for +,-.
                3 - Turn off non-linear arithmetic in the SMT solver. Still,
                    use Boogie/Z3 built-in symbols for all arithmetic operations.
                4 - Like 3, but introduce symbolic synonyms for *,/,%, and allow these
                    operators to be used in triggers.
                5 - Like 4, but introduce symbolic synonyms also for +,-.
                6 - Like 5, and introduce axioms that distribute + over *.
                7 - like 6, and introduce facts that associate literals arguments of *.
                8 - Like 7, and introduce axiom for the connection between *,/,%.
                9 - Like 8, and introduce axioms for sign of multiplication
                10 - Like 9, and introduce axioms for commutativity and
                    associativity of *
  /autoReqPrint:<file>
                Print out requirements that were automatically generated by autoReq.
  /noAutoReq    Ignore autoReq attributes
  /allowGlobals Allow the implicit class '_default' to contain fields, instance functions,
                and instance methods.  These class members are declared at the module scope,
                outside of explicit classes.  This command-line option is provided to simplify
                a transition from the behavior in the language prior to version 1.9.3, from
                which point onward all functions and methods declared at the module scope are
                implicitly static and fields declarations are not allowed at the module scope.
  /countVerificationErrors:<n>
                0 - If preprocessing succeeds, set exit code to 0 regardless of the number
                    of verification errors.
                1 (default) - If preprocessing succeeds, set exit code to the number of
                              verification errors.
  /autoTriggers:<n>
                0 - Do not generate {:trigger} annotations for user-level quantifiers.
                1 (default) - Add a {:trigger} to each user-level quantifier. Existing
                              annotations are preserved.
  /rewriteFocalPredicates:<n>
                0 - Don't rewrite predicates in the body of prefix lemmas.
                1 (default) - In the body of prefix lemmas, rewrite any use of a focal predicate
                              P to P#[_k-1].
  /optimize     Produce optimized C# code, meaning:
                  - selects optimized C# prelude by passing 
                    /define:DAFNY_USE_SYSTEM_COLLECTIONS_IMMUTABLE to csc.exe (requires 
                    System.Collections.Immutable.dll in the source directory to successfully 
                    compile).
                  - passes /optimize flag to csc.exe.
  /optimizeResolution:<n>
                0 - Resolve and translate all methods
                1 - Translate methods only in the call graph of current verification target
                2 (default) - As in 1, but only resolve method bodies in non-included Dafny sources
  /stats        Print interesting statistics about the Dafny files supplied.
  /funcCallGraph Print out the function call graph.  Format is: func,mod=callee*
  /warnShadowing  Emits a warning if the name of a declared variable caused another variable
                to be shadowed
  /definiteAssignment:<n>
                0 - ignores definite-assignment rules; this mode is for testing only--it is
                    not sound to be used with compilation
                1 (default) - enforces definite-assignment rules
                2 - enforces definite-assignment for all non-ghost non-yield-parameter
                    variables and fields, regardless of their types
                3 - like 2, but also performs checks in the compiler that no nondeterministic
                    statements are used; thus, a program that passes at this level 3 is one
                    that the language guarantees that values seen during execution will be
                    the same in every run of the program
  /deprecation:<n>
                0 - don't give any warnings about deprecated features
                1 (default) - show warnings about deprecated features
                2 - also point out where there's new simpler syntax
  /verifyAllModules 
                Verify modules that come from an include directive
  /separateModuleOutput
                Output verification results for each module separately, rather than
                aggregating them after they are all finished.
  /useRuntimeLib
                Refer to pre-built DafnyRuntime.dll in compiled assembly rather
                than including DafnyRuntime.cs verbatim.
  /allocated:<n>
                Specify defaults for where Dafny should assert and assume
                allocated(x) for various parameters x, local variables x,
                bound variables x, etc.  Lower <n> may require more manual
                allocated(x) annotations and thus may be more difficult to use.
                Warning: this option should be chosen consistently across
                an entire project; it would be unsound to use different
                defaults for different files or modules within a project.
                And even so, modes /allocated:0 and /allocated:1 let functions
                depend on the allocation state, which is not sound in general.
                0 - Nowhere (never assume/assert allocated(x) by default).
                1 - Assume allocated(x) only for non-ghost variables and fields
                    (these assumptions are free, since non-ghost variables
                    always contain allocated values at run-time).  This option
                    may speed up verification relative to /allocated:2.
                2 - Assert/assume allocated(x) on all variables,
                    even bound variables in quantifiers.  This option is
                    the easiest to use for heapful code.
                3 - (default) Frugal use of heap parameters.
                4 - mode 3 but with alloc antecedents when ranges don't imply
                    allocatedness.
  /ironDafny    Enable experimental features needed to support Ironclad/Ironfleet. Use of
                these features may cause your code to become incompatible with future
                releases of Dafny.
  /noIronDafny  Disable Ironclad/Ironfleet features, if enabled by default.
  /printTooltips    
                Dump additional positional information (displayed as mouse-over tooltips by 
                the VS plugin) to stdout as 'Info' messages.
  /printIncludes:<None|Immediate|Transitive>
                None is the default.
                Immediate prints files included by files listed on the command line
                Transitive recurses on the files printed by Immediate
                Immediate and Transitive will exit after printing.
  /disableScopes
                Treat all export sets as 'export reveal *'. i.e. don't hide function bodies
                or type definitions during translation.


  /nologo       suppress printing of version number, copyright message
  /env:<n>      print command line arguments
                  0 - never, 1 (default) - during BPL print and prover log,
                  2 - like 1 and also to standard output
  /printVerifiedProceduresCount:<n>
                0 - no
                1 (default) - yes
  /wait         await Enter from keyboard before terminating program
  /xml:<file>   also produce output in XML format to <file>

  ---- Boogie options --------------------------------------------------------

  Multiple .bpl files supplied on the command line are concatenated into one
  Boogie program.

  /proc:<p>      : Only check procedures matched by pattern <p>. This option
                   may be specified multiple times to match multiple patterns.
                   The pattern <p> matches the whole procedure name (i.e.
                   pattern "foo" will only match a procedure called foo and
                   not fooBar). The pattern <p> may contain * wildcards which
                   match any character zero or more times. For example the
                   pattern "ab*d" would match abd, abcd and abccd but not
                   Aabd nor abdD. The pattern "*ab*d*" would match abd,
                   abcd, abccd, Abd and abdD.
  /noResolve     : parse only
  /noTypecheck   : parse and resolve only

  /print:<file>  : print Boogie program after parsing it
                   (use - as <file> to print to console)
  /pretty:<n>
                0 - print each Boogie statement on one line (faster).
                1 (default) - pretty-print with some line breaks.
  /printWithUniqueIds : print augmented information that uniquely
                   identifies variables
  /printUnstructured : with /print option, desugars all structured statements
  /printDesugared : with /print option, desugars calls
  /printLambdaLifting : with /print option, desugars lambda lifting

  /freeVarLambdaLifting : Boogie's lambda lifting transforms the bodies of lambda
                         expressions into templates with holes. By default, holes
                         are maximally large subexpressions that do not contain
                         bound variables. This option performs a form of lambda
                         lifting in which holes are the lambda's free variables. 

  /overlookTypeErrors : skip any implementation with resolution or type
                        checking errors

  /loopUnroll:<n>
                unroll loops, following up to n back edges (and then some)
  /soundLoopUnrolling
                sound loop unrolling
  /printModel:<n>
                0 (default) - do not print Z3's error model
                1 - print Z3's error model
                2 - print Z3's error model plus reverse mappings
                4 - print Z3's error model in a more human readable way
  /printModelToFile:<file>
                print model to <file> instead of console
  /mv:<file>    Specify file where to save the model in BVD format
  /enhancedErrorMessages:<n>
                0 (default) - no enhanced error messages
                1 - Z3 error model enhanced error messages

  /printCFG:<prefix> : print control flow graph of each implementation in
                       Graphviz format to files named:
                         <prefix>.<procedure name>.dot

  /useBaseNameForFileName : When parsing use basename of file for tokens instead
                            of the path supplied on the command line

  ---- Inference options -----------------------------------------------------

  /infer:<flags>
                use abstract interpretation to infer invariants
                The default is /infer:i
                   <flags> are as follows (missing <flags> means all)
                   i = intervals
                   c = constant propagation
                   d = dynamic type
                   n = nullness
                   p = polyhedra for linear inequalities
                   t = trivial bottom/top lattice (cannot be combined with
                       other domains)
                   j = stronger intervals (cannot be combined with other
                       domains)
                or the following (which denote options, not domains):
                   s = debug statistics
                0..9 = number of iterations before applying a widen (default=0)
  /noinfer      turn off the default inference, and overrides the /infer
                switch on its left
  /checkInfer   instrument inferred invariants as asserts to be checked by
                theorem prover
  /interprocInfer

  /instrumentInfer
                h - instrument inferred invariants only at beginning of
                    loop headers (default)
                e - instrument inferred invariants at beginning and end
                    of every block (this mode is intended for use in
                    debugging of abstract domains)
  /printInstrumented
                print Boogie program after it has been instrumented with
                invariants

  ---- Debugging and general tracing options ---------------------------------

  /trace        blurt out various debug trace information
  /traceTimes   output timing information at certain points in the pipeline

  /noVerify     skip VC generation and invocation of the theorem prover
  /verifySnapshots:<n>
                verify several program snapshots (named <filename>.v0.bpl

                0 - do not use any verification result caching (default)
                1 - use the basic verification result caching
                2 - use the more advanced verification result caching
                3 - use the more advanced caching and report errors according
                    to the new source locations for errors and their
                    related locations (but not /errorTrace and CaptureState
                    locations)

                1 - remove empty blocks (default)
  /coalesceBlocks:<c>
                0 = do not coalesce blocks
                1 = coalesce blocks (default)
  /vc:<variety> n = nested block (default for /prover:Simplify),
                m = nested block reach,
                b = flat block, r = flat block reach,
                s = structured, l = local,
                d = dag (default, except with /prover:Simplify)
                doomed = doomed
  /traceverify  print debug output during verification condition generation
  /subsumption:<c>
                apply subsumption to asserted conditions:
                0 - never, 1 - not for quantifiers, 2 (default) - always
  /alwaysAssumeFreeLoopInvariants
                usually, a free loop invariant (or assume
                statement in that position) is ignored in checking contexts
                (like other free things); this option includes these free
                loop invariants as assumes in both contexts
  /inline:<i>   use inlining strategy <i> for procedures with the :inline
                attribute, see /attrHelp for details:
                  none
                  assume (default)
                  assert
                  spec
  /printInlined
                print the implementation after inlining calls to
                procedures with the :inline attribute (works with /inline)
  /lazyInline:1
                Use the lazy inlining algorithm
  /stratifiedInline:1
                Use the stratified inlining algorithm
  /fixedPointEngine:<engine>
                Use the specified fixed point engine for inference
  /recursionBound:<n>
                Set the recursion bound for stratified inlining to
                be n (default 500)
  /inferLeastForUnsat:<str>
                Infer the least number of constants (whose names
                are prefixed by <str>) that need to be set to
                true for the program to be correct. This turns
                on stratified inlining.
  /smoke        Soundness Smoke Test: try to stick assert false; in some
                places in the BPL and see if we can still prove it
  /smokeTimeout:<n>

                   a = arguments
                   m = monomorphic
  /monomorphize   
                Do not abstract map types in the encoding (this is an
                experimental feature that will not do the right thing if
                the program uses polymorphism)
  /reflectAdd   In the VC, generate an auxiliary symbol, elsewhere defined
                to be +, instead of +.

  ---- Verification-condition splitting --------------------------------------

  /vcsMaxCost:<f>
                VC will not be split unless the cost of a VC exceeds this
                number, defaults to 2000.0. This does NOT apply in the
                keep-going mode after first round of splitting.
  /vcsMaxSplits:<n>
                Maximal number of VC generated per method. In keep
                going mode only applies to the first round.
                Defaults to 1.
  /vcsMaxKeepGoingSplits:<n>
                If set to more than 1, activates the keep
                going mode, where after the first round of splitting,
                VCs that timed out are split into <n> pieces and retried
                until we succeed proving them, or there is only one
                assertion on a single path and it timeouts (in which
                case error is reported for that assertion).
                Defaults to 1.
  /vcsKeepGoingTimeout:<n>
                Timeout in seconds for a single theorem prover
                invocation in keep going mode, except for the final
                single-assertion case. Defaults to 1s.
  /vcsFinalAssertTimeout:<n>
                Timeout in seconds for the single last
                assertion in the keep going mode. Defaults to 30s.
  /vcsPathJoinMult:<f>
                If more than one path join at a block, by how much
                multiply the number of paths in that block, to accomodate
                for the fact that the prover will learn something on one
                paths, before proceeding to another. Defaults to 0.8.
  /vcsPathCostMult:<f1>
  /vcsAssumeMult:<f2>
                The cost of a block is
                    (<assert-cost> + <f2>*<assume-cost>) * 
                    (1.0 + <f1>*<entering-paths>)
                <f1> defaults to 1.0, <f2> defaults to 0.01.
                The cost of a single assertion or assumption is
                currently always 1.0.
  /vcsPathSplitMult:<f>
                If the best path split of a VC of cost A is into
                VCs of cost B and C, then the split is applied if
                A >= <f>*(B+C), otherwise assertion splitting will be
                applied. Defaults to 0.5 (always do path splitting if
                possible), set to more to do less path splitting
                and more assertion splitting.
  /vcsDumpSplits
                For split #n dump split.n.dot and split.n.bpl.
                Warning: Affects error reporting.
  /vcsCores:<n>
                Try to verify <n> VCs at once. Defaults to 1.
  /vcsLoad:<f>  Sets vcsCores to the machine's ProcessorCount * f,
                rounded to the nearest integer (where 0.0 <= f <= 3.0),
                but never to less than 1.

  ---- Prover options --------------------------------------------------------

  /errorLimit:<num>
                Limit the number of errors produced for each procedure

  /timeLimit:<num>
                Limit the number of seconds spent trying to verify
                each procedure
  /rlimit:<num>

  /errorTrace:<n>
                0 - no Trace labels in the error output,
                1 (default) - include useful Trace labels in error output,
                2 - include all Trace labels in the error output
  /vcBrackets:<b>
                bracket odd-charactered identifier names with |'s.  <b> is:
                   0 - no (default with non-/prover:Simplify),
                   1 - yes (default with /prover:Simplify)
  /prover:<tp>  use theorem prover <tp>, where <tp> is either the name of
                a DLL containing the prover interface located in the
                Boogie directory, or a full path to a DLL containing such
                an interface. The standard interfaces shipped include:
                    SMTLib (default, uses the SMTLib2 format and calls Z3)
                    Z3 (uses Z3 with the Simplify format)
                    Simplify
                    ContractInference (uses Z3)
                    Z3api (Z3 using Managed .NET API)
  /proverOpt:KEY[=VALUE]
                Provide a prover-specific option (short form /p).
  /proverLog:<file>
                Log input for the theorem prover.  Like filenames
                supplied as arguments to other options, <file> can use the
                following macros:
                    @TIME@    expands to the current time
                    @PREFIX@  expands to the concatenation of strings given
                              by /logPrefix options
                    @FILE@    expands to the last filename specified on the
                              command line
                In addition, /proverLog can also use the macro '@PROC@',
                which causes there to be one prover log file per
                verification condition, and the macro then expands to the
                name of the procedure that the verification condition is for.
  /logPrefix:<str>
                Defines the expansion of the macro '@PREFIX@', which can
                be used in various filenames specified by other options.
  /proverLogAppend
                Append (not overwrite) the specified prover log file
  /proverWarnings
                0 (default) - don't print, 1 - print to stdout,
                2 - print to stderr
  /proverMemoryLimit:<num>
                Limit on the virtual memory for prover before
                restart in MB (default:100MB)
  /restartProver
                Restart the prover after each query
  /proverShutdownLimit<num>
                Time between closing the stream to the prover and
                killing the prover process (default: 0s)
  /platform:<ptype>,<location>
                ptype = v11,v2,cli1
                location = platform libraries directory

  Simplify specific options:
  /simplifyMatchDepth:<num>
                Set Simplify prover's matching depth limit

  Z3 specific options:
  /z3opt:<arg>  specify additional Z3 options
  /z3multipleErrors
                report multiple counterexamples for each error
  /useArrayTheory
                use Z3's native theory (as opposed to axioms).  Currently
                implies /monomorphize.
  /useSmtOutputFormat
                Z3 outputs a model in the SMTLIB2 format.
  /z3types      generate multi-sorted VC that make use of Z3 types
  /z3lets:<n>   0 - no LETs, 1 - only LET TERM, 2 - only LET FORMULA,
                3 - (default) any
  /z3exe:<path>
                path to Z3 executable

  CVC4 specific options:
