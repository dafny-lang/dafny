[^compiler-feature-forall-note]: 'Sequentializing' a `forall` statement refers to compiling it directly to a series of nested loops
    with the statement's body directly inside. The alternative, default compilation strategy
    is to calculate the quantified variable bindings separately as a collection of tuples,
    and then execute the statement's body for each tuple.
    Not all `forall` statements can be sequentialized.

[^compiler-sequence-display-of-characters-note]: This refers to an expression such as `['H', 'e', 'l', 'l', 'o']`, as opposed to a string literal such as `"Hello"`.

[^compiler-infinite-assign-such-that-note]: This refers to assign-such-that statements with multiple variables,
    and where at least one variable has potentially infinite bounds.
    For example, the implementation of the statement `var x: nat, y: nat :| 0 < x && 0 < y && x*x == y*y*y + 1;`
    needs to avoid the naive approach of iterating all possible values of `x` and `y` in a nested loop.

[^compiler-sequence-display-nolambda-note]: Sequence construction expressions often use a direct lambda expression, as in `seq(10, x => x * x)`,
    but they can also be used with arbitrary function values, as in `seq(10, squareFn)`.
