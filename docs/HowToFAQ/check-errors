# ErrorIds are used in Dafny to connect programmatic calls to emit an error message to the code that provides error information and
# quick fixes in-app and to the markdown documentation that gives more explanation of the error than is possible in an error message.
# This script (along with 'check-errors-a') detects inconsistenciees among the various uses of ErrorIds.
#
# The design of errorids uses a C# Enum to define the programmatic ids, so that misspellings are caught by the compiler.
# Second, rather than have one huge file of all the enum constants, they are broken up into categories.  Each category has a different
# prefix (e.g. p_, ref_, ...) and consists of a different set of files. Even though this makes a different enum type for each category,
# all the errorids can be handled uniformly as subtypes of 'Enum'.
# But third, we do not want the, sometimes extensive, error explanation text to have to be placed in the middle of the control flow at every
# call to emit an error message. So the files contaiing the enums of a given category are placed in *Errors.cs files near their respective code.
# A Errors-*.md file is part of the documentation error catalog (at https://dafny.org/dafny/HowToFAQ/Errors). It contains a section for each error
# message: the message (as a heading), Dafny code that elicits the message, and explanatory text.
# To avoid repeating the error explanations both in code and in md files, the md file is generated from the code and a template file.
#
# To take the Parser errors as an example
#   - Errors related to parsing are contained in Dafny.atg, Parser.frame, Scanner.frame and ProgramParser.cs
#   - The file ParserErrors.cs contains the definition of an enum with errorids for the 100 or so possible parsing error messages. 
#     This file can be located near the parsing code,
#   - Each ParseErrors.ErrorId has a prefix p_, but otherwise is a cryptic English NL statement of the problem.
#   - ParseErrors.cs also contains 'Add' methods that define the explanatory text and any quick fix.
#   - Errors-Parser.template is a file that shows the documented error messages and code snippets. The script 'make-error-catalog' does a rudimentary
#     scan of ParseErrors.cs to extract the error explanations and fill them in the template to create Errors-Parser.md.
#     This (generated) file is committed to GH so that it is served to the user as GH markdown pages.
#
# With ErrorIds used in multiple locations, one needs a means to check that they are consistent. This script does that.
# For each error category X
#   - The master list of ErrorIds is the enum definition in XErrors.cs (the ENUM-list)
#   - The Add methods in XErrors.cs use those enums (the ADD-list)
#     - The compiler ensures that ADD-list is a subset of ENUM-list
#     - But anything missing in ADD-list indicates missing documentation (and possible quick fix) in the code
#   - The error ids used in the source code are extracted by simple scanning into CS-list
#     - Again, the compiler ensures that CS-list is a subset of ENUM-list
#     - Any error id in ENUM-list not in CS-list is an unnecssary ErrorId, perhaps come about by refactoring and eliminating code
#       or renaming error ids or because of an inadequacy in the script).
#     - In transition, some error messages will use an ErrorId of 'none'. These will not have any documentation and should be
#       eliminated over time.
#   - In the markdown file (Errors-X.template and the generated Errors-X.md), each heading contains, as an HTML link, the error id 
#     (in text). These are collected into the MD-list.
#      - any ids in ENUM-list and not in MD-list are undocumented errors and should be eliminated over time
#      - any ids in MD-list and not in ENUM-list correspond to non-existent/obsolete errors and should be removed from *.template.
#      - the code snippets in the .md file need to actually produce the advertised error with the correct ErrorId.
#        The check-examples script does this. It is run as part of CI.
#
# Not yet completed matters:
#   - Not all error messages have ErrorIds
#   - Consequently the signatures in Reporting.cs use a mix of string and Enums
#   - Not all errors have explanations or quick fixes or code snipppets.
#   - Not all categories are broken into a .template and .md file, corresponding to cases where there are as yet no or few items
#     in the ADD-list.
# 
# Items to note
#   - The scripts to extract ids depend on uniform coding style:
#       - each use of an id is prefaced by 'ErrorId.' with one ErrorId per line
#       - the enum file has one id per line
#       - the Add methods are named 'Add' and have a consistent layout
#   - There is no check that the prefixes of the enum constants are used consistently
