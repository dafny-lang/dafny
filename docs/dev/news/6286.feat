Real literals now support exponential notation using `e` or `E` to denote the exponent (like `1.23e5` for `123000.0` or `5e-2` for `0.05`). Real literals also support convenient trailing dot shorthand (like `1.` for `1.0`). Trailing dots can be combined with exponential notation, such as `5.e2` for `500.0`.
