Real literals now support scientific notation using `e` or `E` to denote the exponent (like `1.23e5` for `123000.0` or `5e-2` for `0.05`). Real literals also support convenient shorthand forms: trailing dots (like `1.` for `1.0`) and leading dots (like `.5` for `0.5`). These shorthand forms can be combined with scientific notation, such as `.125e3` for `125.0`.
