Real literals now support scientific notation using lowercase `e` to denote the exponent (like `1.23e5` for `123000.0` or `5e-2` for `0.05`). Real literals also support convenient trailing-dot shorthand (like `1.` for `1.0`) and leading-dot shorthand (like `.5` for `0.5` or `.5e2` for `50.0`). Note that explicit `+` signs in exponents are not supported; use `5e2` instead of `5e+2`.
