`dafny build` for Java now creates a library or executable jar file.
- If there is a Main method, the jar is an executable jar. So a simple A.dfy can be built as `dafny build -t:java A.dfy`
and then run as `java -jar A.jar`
- If there is no Main entry point, all the generated class files are assembled into a library jar file that can be used on a
classpath as a java library.
- In both cases, the DafnyRuntime library is included in the generated jar.
- In old and new CLIs, the default name of the jar file is the name of the first dfy file
- In old and new CLIs, the path and name of the output jar file can be given by the --output option, with .jar added if necessary
- As before, the compilation artifacts (.java and .class files) are placed in a directory whose name is the same as the java file
but without the .jar extension and with '-java' appended
- With the new CLI, the generated .java and .class artifacts are deleted unless --spill-translation=true.
- If any other jar files are needed to compile the dafny/java program, they must be on the CLASSPATH;
  the same CLASSPATH used to compile the program is needed to run the program

Having a library or executable jar simplifies the user's task in figuring out how to use the built artifacts.
