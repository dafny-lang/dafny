The Rust compiler backend is no longer marked as internal and is now included in the standard test suite. This means that `%testDafnyForEachCompiler` will now test Rust compilation alongside other backends. The Rust backend now has proper test coverage with `.rs.check` files that capture expected compiler output, improving maintenance and ensuring compatibility with future Dafny changes.
