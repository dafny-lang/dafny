# Fix for Issue #6304: Set extensionality cannot be proved because type of local variables is not assumed

## Issue Summary

Issue #6304 reported that set extensionality proofs fail when using havoc assignments (`var x := *`) for variables with complex types like `set<(object?, int)>`. The problem occurs because the type information (where clause) is not properly assumed during the havoc operation.

## Root Cause Analysis

The issue is in the Dafny-to-Boogie translation. When translating variable declarations with havoc assignments, the generated Boogie code has the wrong order of operations:

**Current (incorrect) order:**
```boogie
havoc A0#0;
defass#A0#0 := true;
```

**Required (correct) order:**
```boogie
defass#A0#0 := true;
havoc A0#0;
```

The problem is that variables with definite assignment tracking have where clauses of the form:
```boogie
var A0#0: Set
   where defass#A0#0
     ==> $Is(A0#0, TSet(Tclass._System.Tuple2(Tclass._System.object?(), TInt)))
       && $IsAlloc(A0#0, TSet(Tclass._System.Tuple2(Tclass._System.object?(), TInt)), $Heap);
```

When `havoc` is executed before `defass#A0#0 := true`, the where clause doesn't constrain the havoc because `defass#A0#0` is false. This means the type information is not assumed, leading to failed set extensionality proofs.

## Investigation Attempts

Several approaches were attempted to fix this issue:

1. **Modifying ProcessRhss**: Attempted to mark the definite assignment tracker before processing havoc RHS, but this didn't work for single assignments.

2. **Modifying TrAssignmentRhs**: Attempted to mark the definite assignment tracker within the havoc handling, but the lhsVar parameter was often null.

3. **Modifying TrVarDeclStmt**: Attempted to mark the definite assignment tracker before processing the assignment in variable declarations.

## Current Status

The fix attempts were not successful due to the complexity of the interaction between definite assignment tracking and the Boogie translation. The issue requires a deeper understanding of the translation pipeline and careful coordination between:

- Variable declaration processing (`TrVarDeclStmt`)
- Assignment processing (`ProcessRhss`, `ProcessUpdateAssignRhss`)
- Definite assignment tracking (`MarkDefiniteAssignmentTracker`)
- LHS builder delegates

## Integration Test

An integration test was added at `Source/IntegrationTests/TestFiles/LitTests/LitTest/verification/set-extensionality-havoc.dfy` that reproduces the issue and can be used to verify when the fix is implemented.

## Next Steps

To properly fix this issue, the following approach is recommended:

1. Ensure that for havoc assignments to variables with definite assignment tracking, the definite assignment tracker is set to `true` before the havoc operation.

2. Modify the LHS builder to avoid double-marking the definite assignment tracker for such cases.

3. Handle both single assignments and multi-assignments consistently.

4. Ensure the fix works for all types that have `HavocCountsAsDefiniteAssignment(isGhost) == true`.

The issue affects set extensionality proofs and potentially other type-dependent reasoning in Dafny verification.
