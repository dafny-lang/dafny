A function can be declared with `reads **`, which allows the function to depend on the allocation set and which correspondingly removes the frame axiom for the function. This allows the function to use unbounded quantifications over objects. Without the frame axiom, any change of the heap (including a call to a method with an empty `modifies` clause, since such a method is still allowed to change the allocation set) may change the value returned by the function.
