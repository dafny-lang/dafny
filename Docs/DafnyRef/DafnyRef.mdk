Comment     : We use four backticks (````) for grammar productions. We use the Java

# Introduction

Dafny [@Leino:Dafny:LPAR16] is a programming language with built-in specification constructs.
The Dafny static program verifier can be used to verify the functional
correctness of programs.

The Dafny programming language is designed to support the static
verification of programs. It is imperative, sequential, supports generic
classes, methods and functions, dynamic allocation, inductive and
co-inductive datatypes, and specification constructs. The
specifications include pre- and postconditions, frame specifications
(read and write sets), and termination metrics. To further support
specifications, the language also offers updatable ghost variables,
recursive functions, and types like sets and sequences. Specifications
and ghost constructs are used only during verification; the compiler
omits them from the executable code.

The Dafny verifier is run as part of the compiler. As such, a programmer
interacts with it much in the same way as with the static type
checker—when the tool produces errors, the programmer responds by
changing the program’s type declarations, specifications, and statements.

The easiest way to try out [Dafny is in your web browser at
rise4fun](http://rise4fun.com/Dafny)[@Rise4fun:dafny]. Once you get a bit
more serious, you may prefer to [download](http://dafny.codeplex.com/) it
to run it on your machine. Although Dafny can be run from the command
line (on Windows or other platforms), the preferred way to run it is in
Microsoft Visual Studio 2012 (or newer) or using emacs, where the Dafny
verifier runs in the background while the programmer is editing the
program.

The Dafny verifier is powered
by [Boogie](http://research.microsoft.com/boogie)
[@Boogie:Architecture;@Leino:Boogie2-RefMan;@LeinoRuemmer:Boogie2]
and [Z3](https://github.com/z3prover)[@deMouraBjorner:Z3:overview].

From verified programs, the Dafny compiler produces code (`.dll` or
`.exe`) for the .NET platform via intermediate C# files. However, the
facilities for interfacing with other .NET code are minimal.

This is the reference manual for the Dafny verification system. It is
based on the following references: 
[@Leino:Dafny:LPAR16;@MSR:dafny:main;
@MSR:dafny:source;@MSR:dafny:quickref; @LEINO:Dafny:Calc;
@LEINO:Dafny:Coinduction;
and the tutorials at @Rise4fun:dafny]

The main part of the reference manual is in top down order except for an
initial section that deals with the lowest level constructs.

[Co-induction Simply]: http://research.microsoft.com/en-us/um/people/leino/papers/krml230.pdf  "Co-induction Simply: Automatic Co-inductive Proofs in a Program Verifier"

## Dafny Example
To give a flavor of Dafny, here is the solution to a competition problem.

```
// VSComp 2010, problem 3, find a 0 in a linked list and return how many
// nodes were skipped until the first 0 (or end-of-list) was found.
// Rustan Leino, 18 August 2010.
// 
// The difficulty in this problem lies in specifying what the return
// value 'r' denotes and in proving that the program terminates.  Both of
// these are addressed by declaring a ghost field 'List' in each
// linked-list node, abstractly representing the linked-list elements
// from the node to the end of the linked list.  The specification can
// now talk about that sequence of elements and can use 'r' as an index
// into the sequence, and termination can be proved from the fact that
// all sequences in Dafny are finite.
// 
// We only want to deal with linked lists whose 'List' field is properly
// filled in (which can only happen in an acyclic list, for example).  To
// that avail, the standard idiom in Dafny is to declare a predicate
// 'Valid()' that is true of an object when the data structure
// representing object's abstract value is properly formed.  The
// definition of 'Valid()' is what one intuitively would think of as the
// ''object invariant'', and it is mentioned explicitly in method pre-
// and postconditions.  As part of this standard idiom, one also declared
// a ghost variable 'Repr' that is maintained as the set of objects that
// make up the representation of the aggregate object--in this case, the
// Node itself and all its successors.

class Node {
  ghost var List: seq<int>
  ghost var Repr: set<Node>
  var head: int
  var next: Node

  predicate Valid()
    reads this, Repr
  {
    this in Repr &&
    1 <= |List| && List[0] == head &&
    (next == null ==> |List| == 1) &&
    (next != null ==>
      next in Repr && next.Repr <= Repr && this !in next.Repr && 
      next.Valid() && next.List == List[1..])
  }

  static method Cons(x: int, tail: Node) returns (n: Node)
    requires tail == null || tail.Valid()
    ensures n != null && n.Valid()
    ensures if tail == null then n.List == [x] 
                            else n.List == [x] + tail.List
  {
    n := new Node;
    n.head, n.next := x, tail;
    if (tail == null) {
      n.List := [x];
      n.Repr := {n};
    } else {
      n.List := [x] + tail.List;
      n.Repr := {n} + tail.Repr;
    }
  }
}

method Search(ll: Node) returns (r: int)
  requires ll == null || ll.Valid()
  ensures ll == null ==> r == 0
  ensures ll != null ==>
            0 <= r && r <= |ll.List| &&
            (r < |ll.List| ==> ll.List[r] == 0 && 0 !in ll.List[..r]) &&
            (r == |ll.List| ==> 0 !in ll.List)
{
  if (ll == null) {
    r := 0;
  } else {
    var jj,i := ll,0;
    while (jj != null && jj.head != 0)
      invariant jj != null ==> jj.Valid() && i + |jj.List| == |ll.List| && 
                               ll.List[i..] == jj.List
      invariant jj == null ==> i == |ll.List|
      invariant 0 !in ll.List[..i]
      decreases |ll.List| - i
    {
      jj := jj.next;
      i := i + 1;
    }
    r := i;
  }
}

method Main()
{
  var list: Node := null;
  list := list.Cons(0, list);
  list := list.Cons(5, list);
  list := list.Cons(0, list);
  list := list.Cons(8, list);
  var r := Search(list);
  print "Search returns ", r, "\n";
  assert r == 1;
}
```


# Lexical and Low Level Grammar
Dafny uses the Coco/R lexer and parser generator for its lexer and parser
(<http://www.ssw.uni-linz.ac.at/Research/Projects/Coco>)[@Linz:Coco].
The Dafny input file to Coco/R is the `Dafny.atg` file in the source tree.
A Coco/R input file consists of code written in the target language 
(&eg; C#) intermixed with these special sections:

0. The Characters section which defines classes of characters that are used
   in defining the lexer (Section [#sec-character-classes]).
1. The Tokens section which defines the lexical tokens (Section [#sec-tokens]).
2. The Productions section which defines the grammar. The grammar productions
are distributed in the later parts of this document in the parts where
those constructs are explained.

The grammar presented in this document was derived from the `Dafny.atg`
file but has been simplified by removing details that, though needed by
the parser, are not needed to understand the grammar. In particular, the
following transformations have been performed.

* The semantics actions, enclosed by "(." and ".)", were removed.
* There are some elements in the grammar used for error recovery
  ("SYNC"). These were removed.
* There are some elements in the grammar for resolving conflicts
  ("IF(b)"). These have been removed.
* Some comments related to Coco/R parsing details have been removed.
* A Coco/R grammar is an attributed grammar where the attributes enable
  the productions to have input and output parameters. These attributes
  were removed except that boolean input parameters that affect
  the parsing are kept. 
  * In our representation we represent these
    in a definition by giving the names of the parameters following
    the non-terminal name. For example `entity1(allowsX)`.
  * In the case of uses of the parameter, the common case is that the
    parameter is just passed to a lower-level non-terminal. In that
    case we just give the name, e.g. `entity2(allowsX)`. 
  * If we want to given an explicit value to a parameter, we specify it in 
    a keyword notation like this: `entity2(allowsX: true)`.
  * In some cases the value to be passed depends on the grammatical context.
    In such cases we give a description of the conditions under which the
    parameter is true, enclosed in parenthesis. For example:
    
      `FunctionSignatureOrEllipsis_(allowGhostKeyword: ("method" present))`
    
    means that the `allowGhostKeyword` parameter is true if the
    "method" keyword was given in the associated ``FunctionDecl``.
  * Where a parameter affects the parsing of a non-terminal we will
    explain the effect of the parameter.


The names of character sets and tokens start with a lower case
letter but the names of grammar non-terminals start with 
an upper-case letter.

The grammar uses Extended BNF notation. See the [Coco/R Referenced
manual](http://www.ssw.uni-linz.ac.at/Research/Projects/Coco/Doc/UserManual.pdf)
for details. But in summary:

* identifiers starting with a lower case letter denote
terminal symbols, 
* identifiers starting with an upper case letter denote nonterminal
symbols.
* Strings denote themselves.
* `=` separates the sides of a production, &eg; `A = a b c` 
* In the Coco grammars "." terminates a production, but for readability
  in this document a production starts with the defined identifier in 
  the left margin and may be continued on subsequent lines if they
  are indented.  
* `|` separates alternatives, &eg; `a b | c | d e` means `a b` or `c or d e`
* `(` `)` groups alternatives, &eg; (a | b) c means a c or b c
* `[ ]` option, &eg; `[a] b` means `a b` or `b`
* `{ }` iteration (0 or more times), &eg; `{a} b` means `b` or `a b` or `a a b` or ...
* We allow `|` inside `[ ]` and `{ }`. So `[a | b]` is short for `[(a | b)]`
  and `{a | b}` is short for `{(a | b)}`.
* The first production defines the name of the grammar, in this case `Dafny`.

In addition to the Coco rules, for the sake of readability we have adopted
these additional conventions.

* We allow `-` to be used. `a - b` means it matches if it matches `a` but not `b`.
* To aid in explaining the grammar we have added some additional productions
that are not present in the original grammar. We name these with a trailing
underscore. If you inline these where they are referenced, the result should
let you reconstruct the original grammar.

**For the convenience of the reader, any references to character sets,
tokens, or grammar non-terminals in this document are hyper-links that
will link to the definition of the entity.**

## Character Classes
This section defines character classes used later in the token definitions.
In this section backslash is used to start an escape sequence, so for example
'\n' denotes the single linefeed character.

````
letter = "ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZabcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz"
````
At present, a letter is an ASCII upper or lowercase letter. Other Unicode letters
are not supported.

````
digit = "0123456789"
````
A digit is just one of the base-10 digits.

````
posDigit = "123456789"
````
A ``posDigit`` is a digit, excluding 0.

````
hexdigit = "0123456789ABCDEFabcdef"
````
A ``hexdigit`` character is a digit or one of the letters from 'A' to 'F' in either case.

````
special = "'_?"
````
The _special_ characters are the characters in addition to alphanumeric characters
that are allowed to appear in a Dafny identifier. These are

* `"'"` because mathematicians like to put primes on identifiers and some ML
  programmers like to start names of type parameters with a "'".
* "_" because computer scientists expect to be able to have underscores in identifiers.
* "?" because it is useful to have "?" at the end of names of predicates, 
  e.g. "Cons?".

````
cr        = '\r'
````
A carriage return character.

````
lf        = '\n'
````
A line feed character.

````
tab       = '\t'
````
A tab character.

````
space = ' '
````
A space character.

````
nondigitIdChar = letter + special
````
The characters that can be used in an identifier minus the digits.

````
idchar = nondigitIdChar + digit
````
The characters that can be used in an identifier.

````
nonidchar = ANY - idchar
````
Any character except those that can be used in an identifier.

````
charChar = ANY - '\'' - '\\' - cr - lf
````
Characters that can appear in a character constant.

````
stringChar = ANY - '"' - '\\' - cr - lf
````
Characters that can appear in a string constant.

````
verbatimStringChar = ANY - '"'
````
Characters that can appear in a verbatim string.

### Comments
Comments are in two forms.

* They may go from "/*" to "*/" and be nested.
* They may go from "//" to the end of the line.

## Tokens
As with most languages, Dafny syntax is defined in two levels. First the stream
of input characters is broken up into _tokens_. Then these tokens are parsed
using the Dafny grammar. The Dafny tokens are defined in this section.

### Reserved Words
The following reserved words appear in the Dafny grammar and may not be used
as identifiers of user-defined entities:

````
reservedword = 
    "abstract" | "array" | "as" | "assert" | "assume" | "bool" | "break" |
    "calc" | "case" | "char" | "class" | "codatatype" | "colemma" |
    "constructor" | "copredicate" | "datatype" | "decreases" |
    "default" | "else" | "ensures" | "exists" | "extends" | "false" |
    "forall" | "free" | "fresh" | "function" | "ghost" | "if" | "imap" | "import" |
    "in" | "include" | "inductive" | "int" | "invariant" | "iset" | "iterator" | "label" |
    "lemma" | "map" | "match" | "method" | "modifies" | "modify" |
    "module" | "multiset" | "nat" | "new" | "newtype" | "null" | "object" |
    "old" | "opened" | "predicate" | "print" | "protected" |
    "reads" | "real" | "refines" | "requires" | "return" | "returns" | "seq" |
    "set" | "static" | "string" | "then" | "this" | "trait" | "true" | "type" |
    "var" | "where" | "while" | "yield" | "yields" | arrayToken

arrayToken = "array" [ posDigit { digit }]
````

An ``arrayToken`` is a reserved word that denotes an array type of
given rank. `array` is an array type of rank 1 (aka a vector). `array2`
is the type of two-dimensional arrays, etc.

TODO: Is "_" is reserved word?

### Identifiers

````
ident = nondigitIdChar { idchar } - arraytoken - chartoken - reservedword 
````
In general Dafny identifiers are sequences of ``idChar`` characters where
the first character is a ``nondigitIdChar``. However tokens that fit this pattern
are not identifiers if they look like an array type token, a character literal,
or a reserved work.

### Digits
````
digits = digit {['_'] digit}
````

A sequence of decimal digits, possibly interspersed with underscores for readability. Example: `1_234_567`.
````
hexdigits = "0x" hexdigit {['_'] hexdigit}
````

A hexadecimal constant, possibly interspersed with underscores for readability.
Example: `0xffff_ffff`.

````
decimaldigits = digit {['_'] digit} '.' digit {['_'] digit}
````
A decimal fraction constant, possibly interspersed with underscores for readability.
Example: `123_456.789_123`.

### Escaped Character
In this section the "\\" characters are literal. 
````
escapedChar =
    ( "\\\'" | "\\&quot;" | "\\\\" | "\\0" | "\\n" | "\\r" | "\\t"
      | "\\u" hexdigit hexdigit hexdigit hexdigit
    )
````

In Dafny character or string literals escaped characters may be used
to specify the presence of the delimiting quote, or back slash,
or null, or new line, or carriage return or tab, or the
Unicode character with given hexadecimal representation.
 
### Character Constant Token
````
charToken = "'" ( charChar | escapedChar ) "'" 
````

A character constant is enclosed by "'" and includes either a character
from the ``charChar`` set, or an escaped character. Note that although Unicode
letters are not allowed in Dafny identifiers, Dafny does support Unicode
in its character and string constants and in its data. A character
constant has type `char`.


### String Constant Token
````
stringToken =
    '"' { stringChar | escapedChar }  '"'
  | '@' '"' { verbatimStringChar | '"' '"' } '"'
````

A string constant is either a normal string constant or a verbatim string constant.
A normal string constant is enclosed by '"' and can contain characters from the 
``stringChar`` set and escapes.

A verbatim string constant is enclosed between '@"' and '"' and can
consists of any characters (including newline characters) except that two
successive double quotes give a way to escape one quote character inside
the string.

## Low Level Grammar Productions

### Identifier Variations

````
Ident = ident 
````
The ``Ident`` non-terminal is just an ``ident`` token and represents an ordinary 
identifier.

````
DotSuffix = 
  ( ident | digits | "requires" | "reads" ) 
````
When using the _dot_ notation to denote a component of a compound entity
the token following the ".", in addition to being an identifier, 
can also be a natural number, or one of the keywords `requires` or `reads`.

* Digits can be used to name fields of classes and destructors of
  datatypes. For example, the built-in tuple datatypes have destructors
  named 0, 1, 2, etc. Note that as a field or destructor name, internal
  underscores matter, so 10 is different from 1_0.
* `m.requires` is used to denote the precondition for method m.
* `m.reads` is used to denote the things that method m may read.

````
NoUSIdent = ident - "_" { idChar }
````
A ``NoUSIdent`` is an identifier except that identifiers with a **leading**
underscore are not allowed. The names of user-defined entities are 
required to be ``NoUSIdent``s. We introduce more mnemonic names
for these below (e.g. ``ClassName``).

````
WildIdent = NoUSIdent | "_" 
````
Identifier, disallowing leading underscores, except the "wildcard"
identifier "_". When "_" appears it is replaced by a unique generated
identifier distinct from user identifiers. 

### NoUSIdent Synonyms
In the productions for the declaration of user-defined entities the name of the 
user-defined entity is required to be an identifier that does not start
with an underscore, i.e., a ``NoUSIdent``. To make the productions more
mnemonic, we introduce the following synonyms for ``NoUSIdent``.

````
ModuleName = NoUSIdent 
ClassName = NoUSIdent 
TraitName = NoUSIdent 
DatatypeName = NoUSIdent 
DatatypeMemberName = NoUSIdent 
NewtypeName = NoUSIdent

FunctionName = NoUSIdent 
PredicateName = NoUSIdent 
CopredicateName = NoUSIdent 
LabelName = NoUSIdent

````
A ``FieldIdent`` is one of the ways to identify a field. The other is
using digits.

### Qualified Names
A qualified name starts with the name of the top-level entity and then is followed by 
zero or more ``DotSuffix``s which denote a component. Examples:

* `Module.MyType1`
* `MyTuple.1`
* `MyMethod.requires`

The grammar does not actually have a production for qualified names
except in the special case of a qualified name that is known to be 
a module name, i.e. a ``QualifiedModuleName``.

### Identifier-Type Combinations
In this section, we describe some nonterminals that combine an identifier and a type.

````
IdentType = WildIdent ":" Type
````
In Dafny, a variable or field is typically declared by giving its name followed by 
a ``colon`` and its type. An ``IdentType`` is such a construct.

````
GIdentType(allowGhostKeyword) = [ "ghost" ] IdentType
````
A ``GIdentType`` is a typed entity declaration optionally preceded by "ghost". The _ghost_
qualifier means the entity is only used during verification but not in the generated code.
Ghost variables are useful for abstractly representing internal state in specifications.
If `allowGhostKeyword` is false then "ghost" is not allowed.

````
LocalIdentTypeOptional = WildIdent [ ":" Type ] 
````
A ``LocalIdentTypeOptional`` is used when declaring local variables. In
such a case a value may be specified for the variable in which case the
type may be omitted because it can be inferred from the initial value.
The initial value value may also be omitted.

````
IdentTypeOptional = WildIdent [ ":" Type ] 
````
A ``IdentTypeOptional`` is typically used in a context where the type of the identifier
may be inferred from the context. Examples are in pattern matching or quantifiers.

````
TypeIdentOptional = [ "ghost" ] ( NoUSIdent | digits ) ":" ] Type
````
``TypeIdentOptional``s are used in ``FormalsOptionalIds``. This represents situations
where a type is given but there may not be an identifier. 

````
FormalsOptionalIds = "(" [TypeIdentOptional  { "," TypeIdentOptional } ] ")" 
````
A ``FormalsOptionalIds`` is a formal parameter list in which the types are required
but the names of the parameters is optional. This is used in algebraic
datatype definitions.

### Numeric Literals
````
Nat = ( digits | hexdigits ) 
````
A ``Nat`` represents a natural number expressed in either decimal or hexadecimal.

````
Dec = (decimaldigits ) 
````
A ``Dec`` represents a decimal fraction literal.

# Programs
````
Dafny = { IncludeDirective_ } { TopDecl } EOF 
````
At the top level, a Dafny program (stored as files with extension `.dfy`)
is a set of declarations. The declarations introduce (module-level)
methods and functions, as well as types (classes, traits, inductive and
co-inductive datatypes, new_types, type synonyms, opaque types, and
iterators) and modules, where the order of introduction is irrelevant. A
class also contains a set of declarations, introducing fields, methods,
and functions. 

When asked to compile a program, Dafny looks for the existence of a
Main() method. If a legal Main() method is found, the compiler will emit
a `.EXE`; otherwise, it will emit a `.DLL`.

 (If there is more than one Main(), Dafny will try to emit an .EXE, but
 this may cause the C# compiler to complain. One could imagine improving
 this functionality so that Dafny will produce a polite error message in
 this case.)

In order to be a legal Main() method, the following must be true:

* The method takes no parameters 
* The method is not a ghost method 
* The method has no requires clause 
* The method has no modifies clause 
* If the method is an instance (that is, non-static) method in a class,
  then the enclosing class must not declare any constructor

Note, however, that the following are allowed:

* The method is allowed to be an instance method as long as the enclosing
  class does not declare any constructor. In this case, the runtime
  system will allocate an object of the enclosing class and will invoke
  Main() on it.
* The method is allowed to have `ensures` clauses 
* The method is allowed to have `decreases` clauses, including a
  `decreases *`. (If Main() has a `decreases *`, then its execution may
  go on forever, but in the absence of a `decreases *` on Main(), Dafny
  will have verified that the entire execution will eventually
  terminate.)

An invocation of Dafny may specify a number of source files.
Each Dafny file follows the grammar of the ``Dafny`` non-terminal.

It consists of a sequence of optional _include_ directives followed by top 
level declarations followed by the end of the file.

## Include Directives
````
IncludeDirective_ = "include" stringToken  
````

Include directives have the form ``"include" stringToken`` where
the string token is either a normal string token or a
verbatim string token. The ``stringToken`` is interpreted as the name of 
a file that will be included in the Dafny source. These included
files also obey the ``Dafny`` grammar. Dafny parses and processes the 
transitive closure of the original source files and all the included files,
but will not invoke the verifier on these unless they have been listed
explicitly on the command line.

## Top Level Declarations
````
TopDecl = { { DeclModifier }
  ( SubModuleDecl
  | ClassDecl
  | DatatypeDecl
  | NewtypeDecl
  | SynonymTypeDecl
  | IteratorDecl
  | TraitDecl
  | ClassMemberDecl(moduleLevelDecl: true)
  } 
````
Top-level declarations may appear either at the top level of a Dafny file,
or within a ``SubModuleDecl``. A top-level declaration is one of the following
types of declarations which are described later.

The ``ClassDecl``, ``DatatypeDecl``, ``NewtypeDecl``,
``SynonymTypeDecl``, ``IteratorDecl``, and ``TraitDecl`` declarations are
type declarations and are describe in Section [#sec-types]. Ordinarily
``ClassMemberDecl``s appear in class declarations but they can also
appear at the top level. In that case they are included as part of an
implicit top-level class and are implicitly `static` (but cannot be
declared as static). In addition a ``ClassMemberDecl`` that appears at 
the top level cannot be a ``FieldDecl``.

## Declaration Modifiers
````
DeclModifier =
  ( "abstract" | "ghost" | "static" | "protected"
  | "extern" [ stringToken]
  )
````

Top level declarations may be preceded by zero or more declaration 
modifiers. Not all of these are allowed in all contexts. 

The "abstract" modifiers may only be used for module declarations. 
An abstract module can leave some entities underspecified.
Abstract modules are not compiled to C#.

The ghost modifier is used to mark entities as being used for 
specification only, not for compilation to code.

The static modifier is used for class members that that
are associated with the class as a whole rather than with
an instance of the class.

The protected modifier is used to control the visibility of the
body of functions. 

The extern modifier is used to alter the CompileName of 
entities. The CompileName is the name for the entity 
when translating to Boogie or C#.

The following table shows modifiers that are available
for each of the kinds of declaration. In the table
we use already-ghost to denote that the item is not
allowed to have the ghost modifier because it is already
implicitly ghost.

+--------------------------+---------------------------------------+
| Declaration              | allowed modifiers                     |

| predicate method         | already-ghost static protected extern |
| inductive predicate      | already-ghost static protected        |
| copredicate              | already-ghost static protected        |
+--------------------------+---------------------------------------+


# Modules

````
SubModuleDecl = ( ModuleDefinition_ | ModuleImport_ ) 
````

Structuring a program by breaking it into parts is an important part of
creating large programs. In Dafny, this is accomplished via _modules_.
Modules provide a way to group together related types, classes, methods,
functions, and other modules together, as well as control the scope of
declarations. Modules may import each other for code reuse, and it is
possible to abstract over modules to separate an implementation from an
interface.

## Declaring New Modules
````
ModuleDefinition_ = "module" { Attribute } ModuleName 
        [ [  "exclusively" ] "refines" QualifiedModuleName ] 
        "{" { TopDecl } "}" 
QualifiedModuleName = Ident { "." Ident } 
````
A qualified name that is known to refer to a module.

A new module is declared with the `module` keyword, followed by the name
of the new module, and a pair of curly braces ({}) enclosing the body
of the module:

```
module Mod {
  ...
}
```

A module body can consist of anything that you could put at the top
level. This includes classes, datatypes, types, methods, functions, etc.

```
module Mod {
  class C {
    var f: int
    method m() 
  }
  datatype Option = A(int) | B(int)
  type T
  method m()
  function f(): int
}
```

You can also put a module inside another, in a nested fashion:

```
module Mod {
  module Helpers {
    class C {
      method doIt()
      var f: int
    }
  }
}
```

Then you can refer to the members of the `Helpers` module within the
`Mod` module by prefixing them with "Helpers.". For example:

```
module Mod {
  module Helpers { ... }
  method m() {
    var x := new Helpers.C;
    x.doIt();
    x.f := 4;
  }
}
```

Methods and functions defined at the module level are available like
classes, with just the module name prefixing them. They are also
available in the methods and functions of the classes in the same
module.

```
module Mod {
  module Helpers {
    function method addOne(n: nat): nat {
      n + 1
    }
  }
  method m() {
    var x := 5;
    x := Helpers.addOne(x); // x is now 6
  }
}
```

## Importing Modules
````
ModuleImport_ = "import" ["opened" ] ModuleName
    [ "=" QualifiedModuleName 
    | "as" QualifiedModuleName ["default" QualifiedModuleName ] 
    ]
    [ ";" ] 
````

Declaring new submodules is useful, but sometimes you want to refer to
things from an existing module, such as a library. In this case, you
can _import_ one module into another. This is done via the `import`
keyword, and there are a few different forms, each of which has a
different meaning. The simplest kind is the concrete import, and has
the form `import A = B`. This declaration creates a reference to the
module `B` (which must already exist), and binds it to the new name
`A`. Note this new name, i.e. `A`, is only bound in the module containing
the import declaration; it does not create a global alias. For
example, if `Helpers` was defined outside of `Mod`, then we could import
it:

```
module Helpers {
  ...
}
module Mod {
  import A = Helpers
  method m() {
    assert A.addOne(5) == 6;
  }
}
```

Note that inside `m()`, we have to use `A` instead of `Helpers`, as we bound
it to a different name. The name `Helpers` is not available inside `m()`,
as only names that have been bound inside `Mod` are available. In order
to use the members from another module, it either has to be declared
there with `module` or imported with `import`.

We don't have to give `Helpers` a new name, though, if we don't want
to. We can write `import Helpers = Helpers` if we want to, and Dafny
even provides the shorthand `import Helpers` for this behavior. You
can't bind two modules with the same name at the same time, so
sometimes you have to use the = version to ensure the names do not
clash.

The ``QualifiedModuleName`` in the ``ModuleImport_`` starts with a
sibling module of the importing module, or with a submodule of the
importing module. There is no wya to refer to the parent module, only
sibling modules (and their submodules).

## Opening Modules

Sometimes, prefixing the members of the module you imported with the
name is tedious and ugly, even if you select a short name when
importing it. In this case, you can import the module as `opened`,
which causes all of its members to be available without adding the
module name. The `opened` keyword must immediately follow `import`, if it
is present. For example, we could write the previous example as:

```
module Mod {
  import opened Helpers
  method m() {
    assert addOne(5) == 6;
  }
}
```

When opening modules, the newly bound members will have low priority,
so they will be hidden by local definitions. This means if you define
a local function called `addOne`, the function from `Helpers` will no
longer be available under that name. When modules are opened, the
original name binding is still present however, so you can always use
the name that was bound to get to anything that is hidden.

```
module Mod {
  import opened Helpers
  function addOne(n: nat): nat {
    n - 1
  }
  method m() {
    assert addOne(5) == 6; // this is now false,
                           // as this is the function just defined
    assert Helpers.addOne(5) == 6; // this is still true
  }
}
```

If you open two modules that both declare members with the same name,
then neither member can be referred to without a module prefix, as it
would be ambiguous which one was meant. Just opening the two modules
is not an error, however, as long as you don't attempt to use members
with common names. The `opened` keyword can be used with any kind of
`import` declaration, including the module abstraction form.

## Module Abstraction

Sometimes, using a specific implementation is unnecessary; instead,
all that is needed is a module that implements some interface.  In
that case, you can use an _abstract_ module import. In Dafny, this is
written `import A : B`.  This means bind the name `A` as before, but
instead of getting the exact module `B`, you get any module which is a
_adheres_ of `B`.  Typically, the module `B` may have abstract type
definitions, classes with bodyless methods, or otherwise be unsuitable
to use directly.  Because of the way refinement is defined, any
refinement of `B` can be used safely. For example, if we start with:

```
module Interface {
  function method addSome(n: nat): nat
    ensures addSome(n) > n
}
module Mod {
  import A : Interface
  method m() {
    assert 6 <= A.addSome(5);
  }
}
```

then we can be more precise if we know that `addSome` actually adds
exactly one. The following module has this behavior. Further, the
postcondition is stronger, so this is actually a refinement of the
Interface module.

```
module Implementation {
  function method addSome(n: nat): nat
    ensures addSome(n) == n + 1
  {
    n + 1
  }
}
```

We can then substitute `Implementation` for `A` in a new module, by
declaring a refinement of `Mod` which defines  `A` to be `Implementation`.

```
module Mod2 refines Mod {
  import A = Implementation
  ...
}
```

You can also give an implementation directly, without introducing a
refinement, by giving a default to the abstract import:

```
module Interface {
  function method addSome(n: nat): nat 
    ensures addSome(n) > n
}
module Mod {
  import A : Interface default Implementation
  method m() {
    assert 6 <= A.addSome(5);
  }
}
module Implementation {
  function method addSome(n: nat): nat 
    ensures addSome(n) == n + 1
  {
    n + 1
  }
}
module Mod2 refines Mod {
  import A : Interface default Implementation
  ...
}
```

Regardless of whether there is a default, the only things known about
`A` in this example is that it has a function `addSome` that returns a
strictly bigger result, so even with the default we still can't prove
that `A.addSome(5) == 6`, only that `6 <= A.addSome(5)`.

When you refine an abstract import into a concrete one, or giving a
default, Dafny checkes that the concrete module is a
refinement of the abstract one. This means that the methods must have
compatible signatures, all the classes and datatypes with their
constructors and fields in the abstract one must be present in the
concrete one, the specifications must be compatible, etc.

## Module Ordering and Dependencies

Dafny isn't particular about which order the modules appear in, but
they must follow some rules to be well formed. As a rule of thumb,
there should be a way to order the modules in a program such that each
only refers to things defined **before** it in the source text. That
doesn't mean the modules have to be given in that order. Dafny will
figure out that order for you, assuming you haven't made any circular
references. For example, this is pretty clearly meaningless:

```
import A = B
import B = A
```

You can have import statements at the toplevel, and you can import
modules defined at the same level:

```
import A = B
method m() {
  A.whatever();
}
module B { ... }
```

In this case, everything is well defined because we can put `B` first,
followed by the `A` import, and then finally `m()`. If there is no
ordering, then Dafny will give an error, complaining about a cyclic
dependency.

Note that when rearranging modules and imports, they have to be kept
in the same containing module, which disallows some pathological
module structures. Also, the imports and submodules are always
considered to be first, even at the toplevel. This means that the
following is not well formed:

```
method doIt() { }
module M {
  method m() {
    doIt();
  }
}
```

because the module `M` must come before any other kind of members, such
as methods. To define global functions like this, you can put them in
a module (called `Globals`, say) and open it into any module that needs
its functionality. Finally, if you import via a path, such as `import A
= B.C`, then this creates a dependency of `A` on `B`, as we need to know
what `B` is (is it abstract or concrete, or a refinement?).

## Name Resolution

When Dafny sees something like `A<T>.B<U>.C<V>`, how does it know what each part
refers to? The process Dafny uses to determine what identifier
sequences like this refer to is name resolution. Though the rules may
seem complex, usually they do what you would expect. Dafny first looks
up the initial identifier. Depending on what the first identifier
refers to, the rest of the identifier is looked up in the appropriate
context. 

In terms of the grammar, sequences like the above are represented as 
a ``NameSegment`` followed by 0 or more ``Suffix``es. A ``Suffix`` is
more general and the form shown above would be for when the
``Suffix`` is an ``AugmentedDotSuffix_``. 

The resolution is different depending on whether it is in 
an expression context or a type context.

### Expression Context Name Resolution

The leading ``NameSegment`` is resolved using the first following
rule that succeeds.

0. Local variables, parameters and bound variables. These are things like
   `x`, `y`, and `i` in `var x;, ... returns (y: int)`, and
   `forall i :: ....` The declaration chosen is the match from the
   innermost matching scope.

1. If in a class, try to match a member of the class. If the member that
   is found is not static an implicit `this` is inserted. This works for
   fields, functions, and methods of the current class (if in a static
   context, then only static methods and functions are allowed). You can
   refer to fields of the current class either as `this.f` or `f`,
   assuming of course that `f` hasn't be hidden by one of the above. You
   can always prefix this if needed, which cannot be hidden. (Note, a
   field whose name is a string of digits must always have some prefix.)

2. If there is no ``Suffix``, then look for a datatype constructor, if
   unambiguous. Any datatypes that don't need qualification (so the
   datatype name itself doesn't need a prefix), and also have a uniquely
   named constructor, can be referred to just by its name. So if
   `datatype List = Cons(List) | Nil` is the only datatype that declares
   `Cons` and `Nil` constructors, then you can write `Cons(Cons(Nil))`.
   If the constructor name is not unique, then you need to prefix it with
   the name of the datatype (for example `List.Cons(List.Nil)))`. This is
   done per constructor, not per datatype.

3. Look for a member of the enclosing module.

4. Module-level (static) functions and methods

TODO: Not sure about the following paragraph.
Opened modules are treated at each level, after the declarations in the
current module. Opened modules only affect steps 2, 3 and 5. If a
ambiguous name is found, an error is generated, rather than continuing
down the list. After the first identifier, the rules are basically the
same, except in the new context. For example, if the first identifier is
a module, then the next identifier looks into that module. Opened modules
only apply within the module it is opened into. When looking up into
another module, only things explicitly declared in that module are
considered.

To resolve expression `E.id`:

First resolve expression E and any type arguments.

* If `E` resolved to a module `M`:
  0. If `E.id<T>` is not followed by any further suffixes, look for
     unambiguous datatype constructor. 
  1. Member of module M: a sub-module (including submodules of imports),
     class, datatype, etc.
  2. Static function or method.
* If `E` denotes a type:
  3. Look up id as a member of that type
* If `E` denotes an expression:
  4. Let T be the type of E. Look up id in T.

### Type Context Name Resolution

In a type context the priority of ``NameSegment`` resolution is:

1. Type parameters.

2. Member of enclosing module (type name or the name of a module).

To resolve expression `E.id`:

* If `E` resolved to a module `M`:
  0. Member of module M: a sub-module (including submodules of imports),
     class, datatype, etc.
* If `E` denotes a type:
  1. If `allowDanglingDotName`: Return the type of `E` and the given `E.id`, 
     letting the caller try to make sense of the final dot-name.
     TODO: I don't under this sentence. What is `allowDanglingDotName`?

# Specifications
Specifications describe logical properties of Dafny methods, functions,
lambdas, iterators and loops. They specify preconditions, postconditions,
invariants, what memory locations may be read or modified, and
termination information by means of _specification clauses_.
For each kind of specification zero or more specification
clauses (of the type accepted for that type of specification)
may be given, in any order.

We document specifications at these levels:

- At the lowest level are the various kinds of specification clauses,
  e.g. a ``RequiresClause_``. 
- Next are the specifications for entities that need them, 
  e.g. a ``MethodSpec``. 
- At the top level are the entity declarations that include
  the specifications, e.g. ``MethodDecl``. 

This section documents the first two of these in a bottom-up manner.
We first document the clauses and then the specifications
that use them. 

## Specification Clauses

### Requires Clause

````
RequiresClause_ = 
    "requires" Expression(allowLemma: false, allowLambda: false)
````

The **requires** clauses specify preconditions for methods,
functions, lambda expressions and iterators. Dafny checks
that the preconditions are met at all call sites. The
callee may then assume the preconditions hold on entry.

If no **requires** clause is specified it is taken to be `true`.

If more than one **requires** clause is given, then the
precondition is the conjunction of all of the expressions
from all of the **requires** clauses.

### Ensures Clause

````
EnsuresClause_ = 
    "ensures" { Attribute } Expression(allowLemma: false, allowLambda: false)
ForAllEnsuresClause_ = 
    "ensures" Expression(allowLemma: false, allowLambda: true)
FunctionEnsuresClause_ = 
    "ensures" Expression(allowLemma: false, allowLambda: false)
````

An **ensures** clause specifies the post condition for a
method, function or iterator.

If no **ensures** clause is specified it is taken to be `true`.

If more than one **ensures** clause is given, then the
postcondition is the conjunction of all of the expressions
from all of the **ensures** clauses.

TODO: In the present sources ``FunctionEnsuresClause_`` differs from
``EnsuresClause_`` only in that it is not allowed to specify
``Attribute``s. This seems like a bug and will likely 
be fixed in a future version.

### Decreases Clause
````
DecreasesClause_(allowWildcard, allowLambda) = 
    "decreases" { Attribute } DecreasesList(allowWildcard, allowLambda)
FunctionDecreasesClause_(allowWildcard, allowLambda) =
    "decreases" DecreasesList(allowWildcard, allowLambda)
````

````
DecreasesList(allowWildcard, allowLambda) = 
  PossiblyWildExpression(allowLambda) 
  { "," PossiblyWildExpression(allowLambda) } 
````
If `allowWildcard` is false but one of the 
``PossiblyWildExpression``s is a wild-card, an error is
reported.

TODO: A ``FunctionDecreasesClause_`` is not allowed to specify
``Attribute``s. this will be fixed in a future version.

**Decreases** clauses are used to prove termination in the
presence of recursion. if more than one **decreases** clause is given
it is as if a single **decreases** clause had been given with the
collected list of arguments. That is, 

```
decreases A, B
decreases C, D
```

is equivalent to

```
decreases A, B, C, D
```

If any of the expressions in the **decreases** clause are wild (i.e. "*")
then proof of termination will be skipped. 

Termination metrics in Dafny, which are declared by **decreases** clauses,
are lexicographic tuples of expressions. At each recursive (or mutually
recursive) call to a function or method, Dafny checks that the effective
**decreases** clause of the callee is strictly smaller than the effective
**decreases** clause of the caller.

 What does "strictly smaller" mean? Dafny provides a built-in
 well-founded order for every type and, in some cases, between types. For
 example, the Boolean "false" is strictly smaller than "true", the
 integer 78 is strictly smaller than 102, the set `{2,5}` is strictly
 smaller than the set `{2,3,5}`, and for "s" of type `seq<Color>` where
 `Color` is some inductive datatype, the color `s[0]` is strictly less than
 `s` (provided `s` is nonempty).

What does "effective decreases clause" mean? Dafny always appends a
"top" element to the lexicographic tuple given by the user. This top
element cannot be syntactically denoted in a Dafny program and it never
occurs as a run-time value either. Rather, it is a fictitious value,
which here we will denote \top, such that each value that can ever occur
in a Dafny program is strictly less than \top. Dafny sometimes also
prepends expressions to the lexicographic tuple given by the user. The
effective decreases clause is any such prefix, followed by the
user-provided decreases clause, followed by \top. We said "user-provided
decreases clause", but if the user completely omits a "decreases" clause,
then Dafny will usually make a guess at one, in which case the effective
decreases clause is any prefix followed by the guess followed by \top.
(If you're using the Dafny IDE in Visual Studio, you can hover the mouse
over the name of a recursive function or method, or the "while" keyword
for a loop, to see the "decreases" clause that Dafny guessed, if any.)

Here is a simple but interesting example: the Fibonacci function.

```
function Fib(n: nat) : nat
{
  if n < 2 then n else Fib(n-2) + Fib(n-1)
}

```

In this example, if you hover your mouse over the function name 
you will see that Dafny has supplied a `**decreases** n` clause.

Let's take a look at the kind of example where a mysterious-looking
decreases clause like "Rank, 0" is useful.

Consider two mutually recursive methods, `A` and `B`:
```
method A(x: nat)
{
  B(x);
}

method B(x: nat)
{
  if x != 0 { A(x-1); }
}
```

To prove termination of `A` and `B`, Dafny needs to have effective
decreases clauses for A and B such that:

* the measure for the callee `B(x)` is strictly smaller than the measure
  for the caller `A(x)`, and

* the measure for the callee `A(x-1)` is strictly smaller than the measure
  for the caller `B(x)`.

Satisfying the second of these conditions is easy, but what about the
first? Note, for example, that declaring both `A` and `B` with "decreases x"
does not work, because that won't prove a strict decrease for the call
from `A(x)` to `B(x)`.

Here's one possibility (for brevity, we will omit the method bodies):
```
method A(x: nat)
  decreases x, 1

method B(x: nat)
  decreases x, 0
```

For the call from `A(x)` to `B(x)`, the lexicographic tuple `"x, 0"` is
strictly smaller than `"x, 1"`, and for the call from `B(x)` to `A(x-1)`, the
lexicographic tuple `"x-1, 1"` is strictly smaller than `"x, 0"`.

 Two things to note: First, the choice of "0" and "1" as the second
 components of these lexicographic tuples is rather arbitrary. It could
 just as well have been "false" and "true", respectively, or the sets
 `{2,5}` and `{2,3,5}`. Second, the keyword **decreases** often gives rise to
 an intuitive English reading of the declaration. For example, you might
 say that the recursive calls in the definition of the familiar Fibonacci
 function `Fib(n)` "decreases n". But when the lexicographic tuple contains
 constants, the English reading of the declaration becomes mysterious and
 may give rise to questions like "how can you decrease the constant 0?".
 The keyword is just that---a keyword. It says "here comes a list of
 expressions that make up the lexicographic tuple we want to use for the
 termination measure". What is important is that one effective decreases
 clause is compared against another one, and it certainly makes sense to
 compare something to a constant (and to compare one constant to
 another).

 We can simplify things a little bit by remembering that Dafny appends
 \top to the user-supplied decreases clause. For the A-and-B example,
 this lets us drop the constant from the **decreases** clause of A: 

```
 method A(x: nat)
   decreases x

method B(x: nat)
  decreases x, 0
```

The effective decreases clause of `A` is `"x, \top"` and the effective
decreases clause of `B` is `"x, 0, \top"`. These tuples still satisfy the two
conditions `(x, 0, \top) < (x, \top)` and `(x-1, \top) < (x, 0, \top)`. And
as before, the constant "0" is arbitrary; anything less than \top (which
is any Dafny expression) would work.

Let's take a look at one more example that better illustrates the utility
of `\top`. Consider again two mutually recursive methods, call them `Outer`
and `Inner`, representing the recursive counterparts of what iteratively
might be two nested loops:
```
method Outer(x: nat)
{
  // set y to an arbitrary non-negative integer
  var y :| 0 <= y;
  Inner(x, y);
}

method Inner(x: nat, y: nat)
{
  if y != 0 {
    Inner(x, y-1);
  } else if x != 0 {
    Outer(x-1);
  }
}
```
The body of `Outer` uses an assign-such-that statement to represent some
computation that takes place before `Inner` is called. It sets "y" to some
arbitrary non-negative value. In a more concrete example, `Inner` would do
some work for each "y" and then continue as `Outer` on the next smaller
"x".

Using a **decreases** clause `"x, y"` for `Inner` seems natural, but if
we don't have any bound on the size of the `"y"` computed by `Outer`,
there is no expression we can write in **decreases** clause of `Outer`
that is sure to lead to a strictly smaller value for `"y"` when `Inner`
is called. `\top` to the rescue. If we arrange for the effective
decreases clause of `Outer` to be `"x, \top"` and the effective decreases
clause for `Inner` to be `"x, y, \top"`, then we can show the strict
decreases as required. Since `\top` is implicitly appended, the two
decreases clauses declared in the program text can be:
```
method Outer(x: nat)
  decreases x

method Inner(x: nat, y: nat)
  decreases x, y
```
Moreover, remember that if a function or method has no user-declared
**decreases** clause, Dafny will make a guess. The guess is (usually)
the list of arguments of the function/method, in the order given. This is
exactly the decreases clauses needed here. Thus, Dafny successfully
verifies the program without any explicit decreases clauses:
```
method Outer(x: nat)
{
  var y :| 0 <= y;
  Inner(x, y);
}

method Inner(x: nat, y: nat)
{
  if y != 0 {
    Inner(x, y-1);
  } else if x != 0 {
    Outer(x-1);
  }
}
```
The ingredients are simple, but the end result may seem like magic. For many users, however, there may be no magic at all -- the end result may be so natural that the user never even has to bothered to think about that there was a need to prove termination in the first place.


### Framing
````
FrameExpression(allowLemma, allowLambda) = 
  ( Expression(allowLemma, allowLambda) [ FrameField ] 
  | FrameField )
````

````
FrameField = "`" Ident 
````

````
PossiblyWildFrameExpression(allowLemma) = 
    ( "*" | FrameExpression(allowLemma, allowLambda: false) )
````

Frame expressions are used to denote the set of memory locations
that a Dafny program element may read or write. A frame 
expression is a set expression. The form `{}` (that is, the empty set)
says that no memory locations may be modified,
which is also the default if no **modifies** clause is given explicitly. 

Note that framing only applies to the heap, or memory accessed through
references. Local variables are not stored on the heap, so they cannot be
mentioned (well, they are not in scope in the declaration) in reads
annotations. Note also that types like sets, sequences, and multisets are
value types, and are treated like integers or local variables. Arrays and
objects are reference types, and they are stored on the heap (though as
always there is a subtle distinction between the reference itself and the
value it points to.)

The ``FrameField`` construct is used to specify a field of a
class object. The identifier following the back-quote is the
name of the field being referenced.
If the `FrameField` is preceded by an expression the expression
must be a reference to an object having that field.
If the `FrameField` is not preceded by an expression then 
the frame expression is referring to that field of the current
object. This form is only used from a method of a class.

The use of ``FrameField`` is discouraged as in practice it has not
been shown to either be more concise or to perform better. 
Also, there's (unfortunately) no form of it for array 
elements---one could imagine 

```
  modifies a`[j]
```
Also, ``FrameField`` is not taken into consideration for
lambda expressions.

### Reads Clause
````
FunctionReadsClause_ = 
  "reads" 
  PossiblyWildFrameExpression (allowLemma: false)
  { "," PossiblyWildFrameExpression(allowLemma: false) }
LambdaReadsClause_ = 
  "reads" PossiblyWildFrameExpression(allowLemma: true)
IteratorReadsClause_ = 
  "reads" { Attribute } 
  FrameExpression(allowLemma: false, allowLambda: false) 
  { "," FrameExpression(allowLemma: false, allowLambda: false) }
PossiblyWildExpression(allowLambda) = 
    ( "*" | Expression(allowLemma: false, allowLambda) ) 
````

Functions are not allowed to have side effects but may be restricted in
what they can read. The _reading frame_ of a function (or predicate) is all
the memory locations that the function is allowed to read. The reason we
might limit what a function can read is so that when we write to memory,
we can be sure that functions that did not read that part of memory have
the same value they did before. For example, we might have two arrays,
one of which we know is sorted. If we did not put a reads annotation on
the sorted predicate, then when we modify the unsorted array, we cannot
determine whether the other array stopped being sorted. While we might be
able to give invariants to preserve it in this case, it gets even more
complex when manipulating data structures. In this case, framing is
essential to making the verification process feasible.

It is not just the body of a function that is subject to **reads**
checks, but also its precondition and the **reads** clause itself.

A reads clause can list a wildcard ("*"), which allows the enclosing
function to read anything. In many cases, and in particular in all cases
where the function is defined recursively, this makes it next to
impossible to make any use of the function. Nevertheless, as an
experimental feature, the language allows it (and it is sound).
Note that a "*" makes the rest of the frame expression irrelevant.

A **reads** clause specifies the set of memory locations that a function,
lambda, or iterator may read. If more than one **reads** clause is given
in a specification the effective read set is the union of the sets
specified. If there are no **reads** clauses the effective read set is
empty. If `"*"` is given in a **reads** clause it means any memory may be
read.

TODO: It would be nice if the different forms of read clauses could be
combined. In a future version the single form of read clause will allow
a list and attributes.

### Modifies Clause

````
ModifiesClause_ = 
  "modifies" { Attribute } 
  FrameExpression(allowLemma: false, allowLambda: false) 
  { "," FrameExpression(allowLemma: false, allowLambda: false) }
````

Frames also affect methods. As you might have guessed, methods are not
required to list the things they read. Methods are allowed to read
whatever memory they like, but they are required to list which parts of
memory they modify, with a modifies annotation. They are almost identical
to their reads cousins, except they say what can be changed, rather than
what the value of the function depends on. In combination with reads,
modification restrictions allow Dafny to prove properties of code that
would otherwise be very difficult or impossible. Reads and modifies are
one of the tools that allow Dafny to work on one method at a time,
because they restrict what would otherwise be arbitrary modifications of
memory to something that Dafny can reason about.

Note that fields of newly allocated objects can always be modified.

It is also possible to frame what can be modified by a block statement
by means of the block form of the 
[modify statement](#sec-modify-statement) (Section [#sec-modify-statement]).

A **modifies** clause specifies the set of memory locations that a
method, iterator or loop body may modify. If more than one **modifies**
clause is given in a specification, the effective modifies set is the
union of the sets specified. If no **modifies** clause is given the
effective modifies set is empty. A loop can also have a
**modifies** clause. If none is given, the loop gets to modify anything
the enclosing context is allowed to modify.

### Invariant Clause
````
InvariantClause_ = 
    "invariant" { Attribute } 
    Expression(allowLemma: false, allowLambda: true)
````

An **invariant** clause is used to specify an invariant
for a loop. If more than one **invariant** clause is given for
a loop the effective invariant is the conjunction of
the conditions specified.

The invariant must hold on entry to the loop. And assuming it
is valid on entry, Dafny must be able to prove that it then
holds at the end of the loop.

## Method Specification
````
MethodSpec = 
  { ModifiesClause_
  | RequiresClause_
  | EnsuresClause_
  | DecreasesClause_(allowWildcard: true, allowLambda: false)
  } 
````

A method specification is zero or more **modifies**, **requires**,
**ensures** or **decreases** clauses, in any order.
A method does not have **reads** clauses because methods are allowed to
read any memory.

## Function Specification
````
FunctionSpec =
  { RequiresClause_
  | FunctionReadsClause_
  | FunctionEnsuresClause_
  | FunctionDecreasesClause_(allowWildcard: false, allowLambda: false)
  } 
````

A function specification is zero or more **reads**, **requires**,
**ensures** or **decreases** clauses, in any order. A function
specification does not have **modifies** clauses because functions are not
allowed to modify any memory.

## Lambda Specification
````
LambdaSpec_ = 
  { LambdaReadsClause_
  | RequiresClause_ 
  } 
````

A lambda specification is zero or more **reads** or **requires** clauses.
Lambda specifications do not have **ensures** clauses because the body
is never opaque. 
Lambda specifications do not have **decreases**
clauses because they do not have names and thus cannot be recursive. A
lambda specification does not have **modifies** clauses because lambdas
are not allowed to modify any memory.

## Iterator Specification
````
IteratorSpec =
  { IteratorReadsClause_
  | ModifiesClause_
  | [ "yield" ] RequiresClause_
  | [ "yield" ] EnsuresClause_
  | DecreasesClause_(allowWildcard: false, allowLambda: false)
  } 
````

An iterator specification applies both to the iterator's constructor
method and to its `MoveNext` method. The **reads** and **modifies**
clauses apply to both of them. For the **requires** and **ensures**
clauses, if `yield` is not present they apply to the constructor,
but if `yield` is present they apply to the `MoveNext` method.

TODO: What is the meaning of a **decreases** clause on an iterator?
Does it apply to `MoveNext`? Make sure our description of 
iterators explains these.

TODO: What is the relationship between the post condition and
the `Valid()` predicate? 
 
## Loop Specification
````
LoopSpec =
  { InvariantClause_
  | DecreasesClause_(allowWildcard: true, allowLambda: true)
  | ModifiesClause_ 
  } 
````

A loop specification provides the information Dafny needs to 
prove properties of a loop. The ``InvariantClause_`` clause
is effectively a precondition and it along with the
negation of the loop test condition provides the postcondition.
The ``DecreasesClause_`` clause is used to prove termination.

# Types
````
Type = DomainType [ "->" Type ] 
````
A Dafny type is a domain type (i.e. a type that can be the domain of a
function type) optionally followed by an arrow and a range type.

````
DomainType =
  ( BoolType_ | CharType_ | NatType_ | IntType_ | RealType_ | ObjectType_
  | FiniteSetType_ | InfiniteSetType_ | MultisetType_ 
  | SequenceType_ | StringType_
  | FiniteMapType_ | InfiniteMapType_ | ArrayType_
  | TupleType_ | NamedType_ ) 
````
The domain types comprise the builtin scalar types, the builtin
collection types, tuple types (including as a special case 
a parenthesized type) and reference types.


Dafny types may be categorized as either value types or reference types.

## Value Types
The value types are those whose values do not lie in the program heap.
These are:

* The basic scalar types: `bool`, `char`, `nat`, `int`, `real`
* The built-in collection types: `set`, `multiset`, `seq`, `string`, `map`, `imap`
* Tuple Types
* Inductive and co-inductive types

Data items having value types are passed by value. Since they are not
considered to occupy _memory_, framing expressions do not reference them.

## Reference Types
Dafny offers a host of _reference types_.  These represent
_references_ to objects allocated dynamically in the program heap.  To
access the members of an object, a reference to (that is, a _pointer_
to or _object identity_ of) the object is _dereferenced_.

The reference types are class types, traits and array types.

The special value `null` is part of every reference
type.[^fn-nullable]

[^fn-nullable]: This will change in a future version of Dafny that
    will support both nullable and (by default) non-null reference
    types.

## Named Types
````
NamedType_ = NameSegmentForTypeName { "." NameSegmentForTypeName }
````

A ``NamedType_`` is used to specify a user-defined type by name
(possibly module-qualified). Named types are introduced by
class, trait, inductive, co-inductive, synonym and opaque
type declarations. They are also used to refer to type variables.

````
NameSegmentForTypeName = Ident  [ GenericInstantiation ] 
````
A ``NameSegmentForTypeName`` is a type name optionally followed by a
``GenericInstantiation`` which supplies type parameters to a generic
type, if needed. It is a special case of a ``NameSegment`` 
(See Section [#sec-name-segment])
that does not allow a ``HashCall``. 

The following sections describe each of these kinds of types in more detail.

# Basic types

Dafny offers these basic types: `bool` for booleans, `char` for
characters, `int` and `nat` for integers, and `real` for reals.

## Booleans
````
BoolType_ = "bool" 
````

There are two boolean values and each has a corresponding literal in
the language:  `false` and `true`.

In addition to equality (`==`) and disequality (`!=`), which are
defined on all types, type `bool` supports the following operations:

+--------------------+------------------------------------+
| operator           | description                        |
+--------------------+------------------------------------+
| `<==>`             | equivalence (if and only if)       |
+--------------------+------------------------------------+
| `==>`              | implication (implies)              |
| `<==`              | reverse implication (follows from) |
+--------------------+------------------------------------+
| `&&`               | conjunction (and)                  |
| [\|\|]{.monospace} | disjunction (or)                   |
+--------------------+------------------------------------+
| `!`                | negation (not)                     |
+--------------------+------------------------------------+

Negation is unary; the others are binary.  The table shows the operators
in groups of increasing binding power, with equality binding stronger
than conjunction and disjunction, and weaker than negation.  Within
each group, different operators do not associate, so parentheses need
to be used.  For example,
```
A && B || C    // error
```
would be ambiguous and instead has to be written as either
```
(A && B) || C
```
or
```
A && (B || C)
```
depending on the intended meaning.

### Equivalence Operator
The expressions `A <==> B` and `A == B` give the same value, but note
that `<==>` is _associative_ whereas `==` is _chaining_.  So,
```
A <==> B <==> C
```
is the same as
```
A <==> (B <==> C)
```
and
```
(A <==> B) <==> C
```
whereas
```
A == B == C
```
is simply a shorthand for
```
A == B && B == C
```

### Conjunction and Disjunction
Conjunction is associative and so is disjunction.  These operators are
_short circuiting (from left to right)_, meaning that their second
argument is evaluated only if the evaluation of the first operand does
not determine the value of the expression.  Logically speaking, the
expression `A && B` is defined when `A` is defined and either `A`
evaluates to `false` or `B` is defined.  When `A && B` is defined, its
meaning is the same as the ordinary, symmetric mathematical
conjunction &and;.  The same holds for `||` and &or;.

### Implication and  Reverse Implication
Implication is _right associative_ and is short-circuiting from left
to right.  Reverse implication `B <== A` is exactly the same as
`A ==> B`, but gives the ability to write the operands in the opposite
order.  Consequently, reverse implication is _left associative_ and is
short-circuiting from _right to left_.  To illustrate the
associativity rules, each of the following four lines expresses the
same property, for any `A`, `B`, and `C` of type `bool`:
```
A ==> B ==> C
A ==> (B ==> C)  // parentheses redundant, since ==> is right associative
C <== B <== A
(C <== B) <== A  // parentheses redundant, since <== is left associative
```
To illustrate the short-circuiting rules, note that the expression
`a.Length` is defined for an array `a` only if `a` is not `null` (see
Section [#sec-reference-types]), which means the following two
expressions are well-formed:
```
a != null ==> 0 <= a.Length
0 <= a.Length <== a != null
```
The contrapositive of these two expressions would be:
```
a.Length < 0 ==> a == null  // not well-formed
a == null <== a.Length < 0  // not well-formed
```
but these expressions are not well-formed, since well-formedness
requires the left (and right, respectively) operand, `a.Length < 0`,
to be well-formed by itself.

Implication `A ==> B` is equivalent to the disjunction `!A || B`, but
is sometimes (especially in specifications) clearer to read.  Since,
`||` is short-circuiting from left to right, note that
```
a == null || 0 <= a.Length
```
is well-formed, whereas
```
0 <= a.Length || a == null  // not well-formed
```
is not.

In addition, booleans support _logical quantifiers_ (forall and
exists), described in section [#sec-quantifier-expression].


## Numeric types

````
IntType_ = "int" 
RealType_ = "real" 
````

Dafny supports _numeric types_ of two kinds, _integer-based_, which
includes the basic type `int` of all integers, and _real-based_, which
includes the basic type `real` of all real numbers.  User-defined
numeric types based on `int` and `real`, called _newtypes_, are
described in Section [#sec-newtypes].  Also, the _subset type_
`nat`, representing the non-negative subrange of `int`, is described
in Section [#sec-subset-types].

The language includes a literal for each non-negative integer, like
`0`, `13`, and `1985`.  Integers can also be written in hexadecimal
using the prefix "`0x`", as in `0x0`, `0xD`, and `0x7c1` (always with
a lower case `x`, but the hexadecimal digits themselves are case
insensitive).  Leading zeros are allowed.  To form negative integers,
use the unary minus operator.

There are also literals for some of the non-negative reals.  These are
written as a decimal point with a nonempty sequence of decimal digits
on both sides.  For example, `1.0`, `1609.344`, and `0.5772156649`.

For integers (in both decimal and hexadecimal form) and reals,
any two digits in a literal may be separated by an underscore in order
to improve human readability of the literals.  For example:
```
1_000_000        // easier to read than 1000000
0_12_345_6789    // strange but legal formatting of 123456789
0x8000_0000      // same as 0x80000000 -- hex digits are often placed in groups of 4
0.000_000_000_1  // same as 0.0000000001 -- 1 \([&Aring;ngstr&ouml;m]{.comment-color}\)
```

In addition to equality and disequality, numeric types
support the following relational operations:

+-----------------+------------------------------------+
| operator        | description                        |
+-----------------+------------------------------------+
| [<]{.monospace} | less than                          |
| `<=`            | at most                            |
| `>=`            | at least                           |
| `>`             | greater than                       |
+-----------------+------------------------------------+

Like equality and disequality, these operators are chaining, as long
as they are chained in the "same direction".  That is,
```
A <= B < C == D <= E
```
is simply a shorthand for
```
A <= B && B < C && C == D && D <= E
```
whereas
```
A < B > C
```
is not allowed.

There are also operators on each numeric type:

+---------------+------------------------------------+
| operator      | description                        |
+---------------+------------------------------------+
| `+`           | addition (plus)                    |
| `-`           | subtraction (minus)                |
+---------------+------------------------------------+
| `*`           | multiplication (times)             |
| `/`           | division (divided by)              |
| `%`           | modulus (mod)                      |
+---------------+------------------------------------+
| `-`           | negation (unary minus)             |
+---------------+------------------------------------+

The binary operators are left associative, and they associate with
each other in the two groups.  The groups are listed in order of
increasing binding power, with equality binding more strongly than the
multiplicative operators and weaker than the unary operator.
Modulus is supported only for integer-based numeric types.  Integer
division and modulus are the _Euclidean division and modulus_.  This
means that modulus always returns a non-negative, regardless of the
signs of the two operands.  More precisely, for any integer `a` and
non-zero integer `b`,
```
a == a / b * b + a % b
0 <= a % b < B
```
where `B` denotes the absolute value of `b`.

Real-based numeric types have a member `Floor` that returns the
_floor_ of the real value, that is, the largest integer not exceeding
the real value.  For example, the following properties hold, for any
`r` and `r'` of type `real`:
```
3.14.Floor == 3
(-2.5).Floor == -3
-2.5.Floor == -2
real(r.Floor) <= r
r <= r' ==> r.Floor <= r'.Floor
```
Note in the third line that member access (like `.Floor`) binds
stronger than unary minus.  The fourth line uses the conversion
function `real` from `int` to `real`, as described in Section
[#sec-numeric-conversion-operations].

## Characters

````
CharType_ = "char" 
````

Dafny supports a type `char` of _characters_.  Character literals are
enclosed in single quotes, as in `'D'`. Their form is described 
by the ``charToken`` nonterminal in the grammar.  To write a single quote as a
character literal, it is necessary to use an _escape sequence_.
Escape sequences can also be used to write other characters.  The
supported escape sequences are as follows:

+--------------------+------------------------------------------------------------+
| escape sequence    | meaning                                                    |
+--------------------+------------------------------------------------------------+
| `\'`               | the character `'`                                          |
| [\\\"]{.monospace} | the character [\"]{.monospace}                             |
| `\\`               | the character `\`                                          |
| `\0`               | the null character, same as `\u0000`                       |
| `\n`               | line feed                                                  |
| `\r`               | carriage return                                            |
| `\t`               | horizontal tab                                             |
| `\u\(_xxxx_\)`     | universal character whose hexadecimal code is `\(_xxxx_\)` |
+--------------------+------------------------------------------------------------+

The escape sequence for a double quote is redundant, because
[\'\"\']{.monospace} and [\'\\\"\']{.monospace} denote the same
character---both forms are provided in order to support the same
escape sequences as for string literals (Section [#sec-strings]).
In the form `\u\(_xxxx_\)`, the `u` is always lower case, but the four
hexadecimal digits are case insensitive.

Character values are ordered and can be compared using the standard
relational operators:

+-----------------+------------------------------------+
| operator        | description                        |
+-----------------+------------------------------------+
| [<]{.monospace} | less than                          |
| `<=`            | at most                            |
| `>=`            | at least                           |
| `>`             | greater than                       |
+-----------------+------------------------------------+

Sequences of characters represent _strings_, as described in Section
[#sec-strings].

The only other operations on characters are obtaining a character
by indexing into a string, and the implicit conversion to string
when used as a parameter of a `print` statement.

TODO: Are there any conversions between `char` values and numeric values?

# Type parameters

````
GenericParameters = "<" TypeVariableName [ "(" "==" ")" ]
      { "," TypeVariableName [ "(" "==" ")" ] } ">" 
````
Many of the types (as well as functions and methods) in Dafny can be
parameterized by types.  These _type parameters_ are typically
declared inside angle brackets and can stand for any type.

It is sometimes necessary to restrict these type parameters so that
they can only be instantiated by certain families of types.  As such,
Dafny distinguishes types that support the equality operation
not only in ghost contexts but also in compiled contexts.  To indicate
that a type parameter is restricted to such _equality supporting_
types, the name of the type parameter takes the suffix
"`(==)`".[^fn-type-mode]  For example,
```
method Compare<T(==)>(a: T, b: T) returns (eq: bool)
{
  if a == b { eq := true; } else { eq := false; }
}
```
is a method whose type parameter is restricted to equality-supporting
types.  Again, note that _all_ types support equality in _ghost_
contexts; the difference is only for non-ghost (that is, compiled)
code.  Co-inductive datatypes, function types, as well as inductive
datatypes with ghost parameters are examples of types that are not
equality supporting.

[^fn-type-mode]:  Being equality-supporting is just one of many
    _modes_ that one can imagine types in a rich type system to have.
    For example, other modes could include having a total order,
    being zero-initializable, and possibly being uninhabited.  If
    Dafny were to support more modes in the future, the "`(\(&nbsp;\))`"-suffix
    syntax may be extended.  For now, the suffix can only indicate the
    equality-supporting mode.

Dafny has some inference support that makes certain signatures less
cluttered (described in a different part of the Dafny language
reference).  In some cases, this support will
infer that a type parameter must be restricted to equality-supporting
types, in which case Dafny adds the "`(==)`" automatically.

TODO: Need to describe type inference somewhere.

# Generic Instantiation
````
GenericInstantiation = "<" Type { "," Type } ">" 
````
When a generic entity is used, actual types must be specified for each
generic parameter. This is done using a ``GenericInstantiation``.
If the `GenericInstantiation` is omitted, type inference will try
to fill these in.

# Collection types

Dafny offers several built-in collection types.

## Sets
````
FiniteSetType_ = "set" [ GenericInstantiation ]
InfiniteSetType_ = "iset" [ GenericInstantiation ]
````

For any type `T`, each value of type `set<T>` is a finite set of
`T` values.

TODO: 
Set membership is determined by equality in the type `T`,
so `set<T>` can be used in a non-ghost context only if `T` is equality
supporting.

For any type `T`, each value of type `iset<T>` is a potentially infinite
set of `T` values.

A set can be formed using a _set display_ expression, which is a
possibly empty, unordered, duplicate-insensitive list of expressions
enclosed in curly braces.  To illustrate,
```
{}        {2, 7, 5, 3}        {4+2, 1+5, a*b}
```
are three examples of set displays. There is also a _set comprehension_
expression (with a binder, like in logical quantifications), described in
section [#sec-set-comprehension-expressions].

In addition to equality and disequality, set types
support the following relational operations:

+-----------------+------------------------------------+
| operator        | description                        |
+-----------------+------------------------------------+
| [<]{.monospace} | proper subset                      |
| `<=`            | subset                             |
| `>=`            | superset                           |
| `>`             | proper superset                    |
+-----------------+------------------------------------+

Like the arithmetic relational operators, these operators are
chaining.

Sets support the following binary operators, listed in order of
increasing binding power:

+---------------+------------------------------------+
| operator      | description                        |
+---------------+------------------------------------+
| `!!`          | disjointness                       |
+---------------+------------------------------------+
| `+`           | set union                          |
| `-`           | set difference                     |
+---------------+------------------------------------+
| `*`           | set intersection                   |
+---------------+------------------------------------+

The associativity rules of `+`, `-`, and `*` are like those of the
arithmetic operators with the same names.  The expression `A !! B`,
whose binding power is the same as equality (but which neither
associates nor chains with equality), says that sets `A` and `B` have
no elements in common, that is, it is equivalent to
```
A * B == {}
```
However, the disjointness operator is chaining, so `A !! B !! C !! D`
means:
```
A * B == {} && (A + B) * C == {} && (A + B + C) * D == {}
```

In addition, for any set `s` of type `set<T>` or `iset<T>` and any
expression `e` of type `T`, sets support the following operations:

+---------------------+------------------------------------+
| expression          | description                        |
+---------------------+------------------------------------+
| [\|s\|]{.monospace} | set cardinality                    |
| `e in s`            | set membership                     |
| `e !in s`           | set non-membership                 |
+---------------------+------------------------------------+

The expression `e !in s` is a syntactic shorthand for `!(e in s)`.

## Multisets
````
MultisetType_ = "multiset" [ GenericInstantiation ] 
````

A _multiset_ is similar to a set, but keeps track of the multiplicity
of each element, not just its presence or absence.  For any type `T`,
each value of type `multiset<T>` is a map from `T` values to natural
numbers denoting each element's multiplicity.  Multisets in Dafny
are finite, that is, they contain a finite number of each of a finite
set of elements.  Stated differently, a multiset maps only a finite
number of elements to non-zero (finite) multiplicities.

Like sets, multiset membership is determined by equality in the type
`T`, so `multiset<T>` can be used in a non-ghost context only if `T`
is equality supporting.

A multiset can be formed using a _multiset display_ expression, which
is a possibly empty, unordered list of expressions enclosed in curly
braces after the keyword `multiset`.  To illustrate,
```
multiset{}    multiset{0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5}    multiset{4+2, 1+5, a*b}
```
are three examples of multiset displays.  There is no multiset
comprehension expression.

In addition to equality and disequality, multiset types
support the following relational operations:

+-----------------+------------------------------------+
| operator        | description                        |
+-----------------+------------------------------------+
| [<]{.monospace} | proper multiset subset             |
| `<=`            | multiset subset                    |
| `>=`            | multiset superset                  |
| `>`             | proper multiset superset           |
+-----------------+------------------------------------+

Like the arithmetic relational operators, these operators are
chaining.

Multisets support the following binary operators, listed in order of
increasing binding power:

+---------------+------------------------------------+
| operator      | description                        |
+---------------+------------------------------------+
| `!!`          | multiset disjointness              |
+---------------+------------------------------------+
| `+`           | multiset union                     |
| `-`           | multiset difference                |
+---------------+------------------------------------+
| `*`           | multiset intersection              |
+---------------+------------------------------------+

The associativity rules of `+`, `-`, and `*` are like those of the
arithmetic operators with the same names. The `+` operator
adds the multiplicity of corresponding elements, the `-` operator
subtracts them (but 0 is the minimum multiplicity),
and the `*` has multiplicity that is the minimum of the
multiplicity of the operands.

The expression `A !! B`
says that multisets `A` and `B` have no elements in common, that is,
it is equivalent to
```
A * B == multiset{}
```
Like the analogous set operator, `!!` is chaining.

In addition, for any multiset `s` of type `multiset<T>`,
expression `e` of type `T`, and non-negative integer-based numeric
`n`, multisets support the following operations:

+---------------------+------------------------------------------+
| expression          | description                              |
+---------------------+------------------------------------------+
| [\|s\|]{.monospace} | multiset cardinality                     |
| `e in s`            | multiset membership                      |
| `e !in s`           | multiset non-membership                  |
| `s[e]`              | multiplicity of `e` in `s`               |
| `s[e := n]`         | multiset update (change of multiplicity) |
+---------------------+------------------------------------------+

The expression `e in s` returns `true` if and only if `s[e] != 0`.
The expression `e !in s` is a syntactic shorthand for `!(e in s)`.
The expression `s[e := n]` denotes a multiset like
`s`, but where the multiplicity of element `e` is `n`.  Note that
the multiset update `s[e := 0]` results in a multiset like `s` but
without any occurrences of `e` (whether or not `s` has occurrences of
`e` in the first place).  As another example, note that
`s - multiset{e}` is equivalent to:
```
if e in s then s[e := s[e] - 1] else s
```

## Sequences
````
SequenceType_ = "seq" [ GenericInstantiation ] 
````

For any type `T`, a value of type `seq<T>` denotes a _sequence_ of `T`
elements, that is, a mapping from a finite downward-closed set of natural
numbers (called _indices_) to `T` values.  (Thinking of it as a map,
a sequence is therefore something of a dual of a multiset.)

### Sequence Displays
A sequence can be formed using a _sequence display_ expression, which
is a possibly empty, ordered list of expressions enclosed in square
brackets.  To illustrate,
```
[]        [3, 1, 4, 1, 5, 9, 3]        [4+2, 1+5, a*b]
```
are three examples of sequence displays.  There is no sequence
comprehension expression.

### Sequence Relational Operators
In addition to equality and disequality, sequence types
support the following relational operations:

+-----------------+------------------------------------+
| operator        | description                        |
+-----------------+------------------------------------+
| [<]{.monospace} | proper prefix                      |
| `<=`            | prefix                             |
+-----------------+------------------------------------+

Like the arithmetic relational operators, these operators are
chaining.  Note the absence of `>` and `>=`.

### Sequence Concatenation
Sequences support the following binary operator:

+---------------+------------------------------------+
| operator      | description                        |
+---------------+------------------------------------+
| `+`           | concatenation                      |
+---------------+------------------------------------+

Operator `+` is associative, like the arithmetic operator with the
same name.

### Other Sequence Expressions
In addition, for any sequence `s` of type `seq<T>`, expression `e`
of type `T`, integer-based numeric `i` satisfying `0 <= i < |s|`, and
integer-based numerics `lo` and `hi` satisfying
`0 <= lo <= hi <= |s|`, sequences support the following operations:

+---------------------+----------------------------------------+
| expression          | description                            |
+---------------------+----------------------------------------+
| [\|s\|]{.monospace} | sequence length                        |
| `s[i]`              | sequence selection                     |
| `s[i := e]`         | sequence update                        |
| `e in s`            | sequence membership                    |
| `e !in s`           | sequence non-membership                |
| `s[lo..hi]`         | subsequence                            |
| `s[lo..]`           | drop                                   |
| `s[..hi]`           | take                                   |
| `s[\(_slices_\)]`   | slice                                  |
| `multiset(s)`       | sequence conversion to a `multiset<T>` |
+---------------------+----------------------------------------+

Expression `s[i := e]` returns a sequence like `s`, except that the
element at index `i` is `e`.  The expression `e in s` says there
exists an index `i` such that `s[i] == e`.  It is allowed in non-ghost
contexts only if the element type `T` is equality supporting.
The expression `e !in s` is a syntactic shorthand for `!(e in s)`.

Expression `s[lo..hi]` yields a sequence formed by taking the first
`hi` elements and then dropping the first `lo` elements.  The
resulting sequence thus has length `hi - lo`.  Note that `s[0..|s|]`
equals `s`.  If the upper bound is omitted, it
defaults to `|s|`, so `s[lo..]` yields the sequence formed by dropping
the first `lo` elements of `s`.  If the lower bound is omitted, it
defaults to `0`, so `s[..hi]` yields the sequence formed by taking the
first `hi` elements of `s`.

In the sequence slice operation, `\(_slices_\)` is a nonempty list of
length designators separated and optionally terminated by a colon, and
there is at least one colon.  Each length designator is a non-negative
integer-based numeric, whose sum is no greater than `|s|`.  If there
are _k_ colons, the operation produces _k + 1_ consecutive subsequences
from `s`, each of the length indicated by the corresponding length
designator, and returns these as a sequence of
sequences.[^fn-slice-into-tuple] If `\(_slices_\)` is terminated by a
colon, then the length of the last slice extends until the end of `s`,
that is, its length is `|s|` minus the sum of the given length
designators.  For example, the following equalities hold, for any
sequence `s` of length at least `10`:
```
var t := [3.14, 2.7, 1.41, 1985.44, 100.0, 37.2][1:0:3];
assert |t| == 3 && t[0] == [3.14] && t[1] == [];
assert t[2] == [2.7, 1.41, 1985.44];
var u := [true, false, false, true][1:1:];
assert |u| == 3 && u[0][0] && !u[1][0] && u[2] == [false, true];
assert s[10:][0] == s[..10];
assert s[10:][1] == s[10..];
```

[^fn-slice-into-tuple]:  Now that Dafny supports built-in tuples, the
    plan is to change the sequence slice operation to return not a
    sequence of subsequences, but a tuple of subsequences.

The operation `multiset(s)` yields the multiset of elements of
sequence `s`.  It is allowed in non-ghost contexts only if the element
type `T` is equality supporting.

### Strings
````
StringType_ = "string" 
````

A special case of a sequence type is `seq<char>`, for which Dafny
provides a synonym: `string`.  Strings are like other sequences, but
provide additional syntax for sequence display expressions, namely
_string literals_.  There are two forms of the syntax for string
literals:  the _standard form_ and the _verbatim form_.

String literals of the standard form are enclosed in double quotes, as
in `"Dafny"`.  To include a double quote in such a string literal,
it is necessary to use an escape sequence.  Escape sequences can also
be used to include other characters.  The supported escape sequences
are the same as those for character literals, see Section [#sec-characters].
For example, the Dafny expression `"say \"yes\""` represents the
string `'say "yes"'`.
The escape sequence for a single quote is redundant, because
[\"\'\"]{.monospace} and [\"\\\'\"]{.monospace} denote the same
string---both forms are provided in order to support the same
escape sequences as for character literals.

String literals of the verbatim form are bracketed by
[@\"]{.monospace} and [\"]{.monospace}, as in `@"Dafny"`.  To include
a double quote in such a string literal, it is necessary to use the
escape sequence [\"\"]{.monospace}, that is, to write the character
twice.  In the verbatim form, there are no other escape sequences.
Even characters like newline can be written inside the string literal
(hence spanning more than one line in the program text).

For example, the following three expressions denote the same string:
```
"C:\\tmp.txt"
@"C:\tmp.txt"
['C', ':', '\\', 't', 'm', 'p', '.', 't', 'x', 't']
```

Since strings are sequences, the relational operators [<]{.monospace}
and `<=` are defined on them.  Note, however, that these operators
still denote proper prefix and prefix, respectively, not some kind of
alphabetic comparison as might be desirable, for example, when
sorting strings.

## Finite and Infinite Maps
````
FiniteMapType_ = "map" [ GenericInstantiation ] 
InfiniteMapType_ = "imap" [ GenericInstantiation ] 
````

For any types `T` and `U`, a value of type `map<T,U>` denotes a
_(finite) map_
from `T` to `U`.  In other words, it is a look-up table indexed by
`T`.  The _domain_ of the map is a finite set of `T` values that have
associated `U` values.  Since the keys in the domain are compared
using equality in the type `T`, type `map<T,U>` can be used in a
non-ghost context only if `T` is equality supporting.

Similarly, for any types `T` and `U`, a value of type `imap<T,U>`
denotes a _(possibly) infinite map_.  In most regards, `imap<T,U>` is
like `map<T,U>`, but a map of type `imap<T,U>` is allowed to have an
infinite domain.

A map can be formed using a _map display_ expression (see ``MapDisplayExpr``),
which is a possibly empty, ordered list of _maplets_, each maplet having the
form `t := u` where `t` is an expression of type `T` and `u` is an
expression of type `U`, enclosed in square brackets after the keyword
`map`.  To illustrate,
```
map[]    map[20 := true, 3 := false, 20 := false]    map[a+b := c+d]
```
are three examples of map displays.  By using the keyword `imap`
instead of `map`, the map produced will be of type `imap<T,U>`
instead of `map<T,U>`.  Note that an infinite map (`imap`) is allowed
to have a finite domain, whereas a finite map (`map`) is not allowed
to have an infinite domain.
If the same key occurs more than
once, only the last occurrence appears in the resulting
map.[^fn-map-display]  There is also a _map comprehension expression_,
explained in section [#sec-map-comprehension-expression].

[^fn-map-display]: This is likely to change in the future to disallow
    multiple occurrences of the same key.

For any map `fm` of type `map<T,U>`,
any map `m` of type `map<T,U>` or `imap<T,U>`,
any expression `t` of type `T`,
any expression `u` of type `U`, and any `d` in the domain of `m` (that
is, satisfying `d in m`), maps support the following operations:

+----------------------+------------------------------------+
| expression           | description                        |
+----------------------+------------------------------------+
| [\|fm\|]{.monospace} | map cardinality                    |
| `m[d]`               | map selection                      |
| `m[t := u]`          | map update                         |
| `t in m`             | map domain membership              |
| `t !in m`            | map domain non-membership          |
+----------------------+------------------------------------+

`|fm|` denotes the number of mappings in `fm`, that is, the
cardinality of the domain of `fm`.  Note that the cardinality operator
is not supported for infinite maps.
Expression `m[d]` returns the `U` value that `m` associates with `d`.
Expression `m[t := u]` is a map like `m`, except that the
element at key `t` is `u`.  The expression `t in m` says `t` is in the
domain of `m` and `t !in m` is a syntactic shorthand for
`!(t in m)`.[^fn-map-membership]

[^fn-map-membership]: This is likely to change in the future as
    follows:  The `in` and `!in` operations will no longer be
    supported on maps.  Instead, for any map `m`, `m.Domain` will
    return its domain as a set and `m.Range` will return, also as a
    set, the image of `m` under its domain.

Here is a small example, where a map `cache` of type `map<int,real>`
is used to cache computed values of Joule-Thomson coefficients for
some fixed gas at a given temperature:
```
if K in cache {  // check if temperature is in domain of cache
  coeff := cache[K];  // read result in cache
} else {
  coeff := ComputeJouleThomsonCoefficient(K);  // do expensive computation
  cache := cache[K := coeff];  // update the cache
}
```

# Types that stand for other types
````
SynonymTypeDecl = 
  ( SynonymTypeDefinition_ | OpaqueTypeDefinition_ ) [ ";" ] 
````
It is sometimes useful to know a type by several names or to treat a
type abstractly. Synonym and opaque types serve this purpose.

## Type synonyms
````
SynonymTypeDefinition_ =
  "type" { Attribute } SynonymTypeName [ GenericParameters ] "=" Type
````

A _type synonym_ declaration:
```
type Y<T> = G
```
declares `Y<T>` to be a synonym for the type `G`.  Here, `T` is a
nonempty list of type parameters (each of which is optionally
designated with the suffix "`(==)`"), which can be used as free type
variables in `G`.  If the synonym has no type parameters, the "`<T>`"
is dropped.  In all cases, a type synonym is just a synonym.  That is,
there is never a difference, other than possibly in error messages
produced, between `Y<T>` and `G`.

For example, the names of the following type synonyms may improve the
readability of a program:
```
type Replacements<T> = map<T,T>
type Vertex = int
```

As already described in Section [#sec-strings], `string` is a built-in
type synonym for `seq<char>`, as if it would have been declared as
follows:
```
type string = seq<char>
```

## Opaque types
````
OpaqueTypeDefinition_ = "type" { Attribute } SynonymTypeName 
  [ "(" "==" ")" ] [ GenericParameters ] 
````

A special case of a type synonym is one that is underspecified.  Such
a type is declared simply by:
```
type Y<T>
```
It is known as an _opaque type_.  Its definition can be revealed in a
refining module.  To indicate that `Y` designates an
equality-supporting type, "`(==)`" can be written immediately
following the name "`Y`".

For example, the declarations
```
type T
function F(t: T): T
```
can be used to model an uninterpreted function `F` on some
arbitrary type `T`.  As another example,
```
type Monad<T>
```
can be used abstractly to represent an arbitrary parameterized monad.

# Well-founded Functions and Extreme Predicates
This section is a tutorial on well-founded functions and extreme predicates.
We place it here in preparation for Section [#sec-class-types]
where function and predicate definitions are described.

Recursive functions are a core part of computer science and mathematics.
Roughly speaking, when the definition of such a function spells out a
terminating computation from given arguments, we may refer to
it as a _well-founded function_.  For example, the common factorial and
Fibonacci functions are well-founded functions.

There are also other ways to define functions.  An important case
regards the definition of a boolean function as an extreme solution
(that is, a least or greatest solution) to some equation.  For
computer scientists with interests in logic or programming languages,
these _extreme predicates_ are important because they describe the
judgments that can be justified by a given set of inference rules
(see, e.g., [@CamilleriMelham:InductiveRelations;
@Winskel:FormalSemantics;
  @LeroyGrall:CoinductiveBigStep; @Pierce:SoftwareFoundations;
  @NipkowKlein:ConcreteSemantics]).

To benefit from machine-assisted reasoning, it is necessary not just
to understand extreme predicates but also to have techniques for
proving theorems about them.  A foundation for this reasoning was
developed by Paulin-Mohring [@PaulinMohring:InductiveCoq] and is the
basis of the constructive logic supported by Coq [@Coq:book] as well
as other proof assistants [@BoveDybjerNorell:BriefAgda;
@SwamyEtAl:Fstar2011].  Essentially, the idea is to represent the
knowledge that an extreme predicate holds by the proof term by which
this knowledge was derived.  For a predicate defined as the least
solution, such proof terms are values of an inductive datatype (that
is, finite proof trees), and for the greatest solution, a coinductive
datatype (that is, possibly infinite proof trees).  This means that
one can use induction and coinduction when reasoning about these proof
trees.  Therefore, these extreme predicates are known as,
respectively, _inductive predicates_ and _coinductive predicates_ (or,
_co-predicates_ for short).  Support for extreme predicates is also
available in the proof assistants Isabelle [@Paulson:CADE1994] and HOL
[@Harrison:InductiveDefs].

Dafny supports both well-founded functions and extreme predicates.
This section is a tutorial that describes the difference in general
terms, and then describes novel syntactic support in Dafny for
defining and proving lemmas with extreme predicates.  Although Dafny's
verifier has at its core a first-order SMT solver, Dafny's logical
encoding makes it possible to reason about fixpoints in an automated
way.

The encoding for coinductive predicates in Dafny was described previously
[@LeinoMoskal:Coinduction] and is here described in Section
[#sec-co-inductive-datatypes].

## Function Definitions

To define a function $f \colon X \to Y$ in terms of itself, one can
write an equation like

~ Equation {#eq-general}
  f \Equal \F(f)
~

where $\mathcal{F}$ is a non-recursive function of type
$(X \to Y) \to X \to Y$.  Because it takes a function as an argument,
$\mathcal{F}$ is referred to as a _functor_ (or _functional_, but not to be
confused by the category-theory notion of a functor).
Throughout, I will assume that $\F(f)$ by itself is well defined,
for example that it does not divide by zero.  I will also assume that $f$ occurs
only in fully applied calls in $\F(f)$; eta expansion can be applied to
ensure this.  If $f$ is a boolean function, that is, if $Y$ is
the type of booleans, then I call $f$ a _predicate_.

For example, the common Fibonacci function over the
natural numbers can be defined by the equation

~ Equation
  \fib \Equal
  \lambda n \bullet\; \ite{n < 2}{n}{\fib(n-2) + \fib(n-1)}
~

With the understanding that the argument $n$ is universally
quantified, we can write this equation equivalently as

~ Equation {#eq-fib}
  \fib(n) \Equal
  \ite{n < 2}{n}{\fib(n-2) + \fib(n-1)}
~

The fact that the function being defined occurs on both sides of the equation
causes concern that we might not be defining the function properly, leading to a
logical inconsistency.  In general, there
could be many solutions to an equation like [#eq-general] or there could be none.
Let's consider two ways to make sure we're defining the function uniquely. 

### Well-founded Functions

A standard way to ensure that equation [#eq-general] has a unique solution in $f$ is
to make sure the recursion is well-founded, which roughly means that the
recursion terminates.  This is done by introducing any well-founded
relation $\Less$ on the domain of $f$ and making sure that the argument to each recursive
call goes down in this ordering.  More precisely, if we formulate [#eq-general] as

~ Equation
  f(x) \Equal \F'(f)
~

then we want to check $E \Less x$ for each call $f(E)$ in $\F'(f)$.  When a function
definition satisfies  this _decrement condition_, then the function is said to be
_well-founded_.

For example, to check the decrement condition for $\fib$ in [#eq-fib], we can pick
$\Less$ to be the arithmetic less-than relation on natural numbers and check the
following, for any $n$:

~ Equation
  2 \leq n \;\;\Imp\;\; n-2 \Less n \;\And\; n-1 \Less n
~

Note that we are entitled to using the antecedent $2 \leq n$, because that is the
condition under which the else branch in [#eq-fib] is evaluated.

A well-founded function is often thought of as "terminating" in the sense
that the recursive _depth_ in evaluating $f$
on any given argument is finite.  That is, there are no infinite descending chains
of recursive calls.  However, the evaluation of $f$ on a given argument
may fail to terminate, because its _width_ may be infinite.  For example, let $P$
be some predicate defined on the ordinals and let $\PDownward$ be a predicate on the
ordinals defined by the following equation:

~ Equation
  \PDownward(o)  \Equal
  P(o) \And \forall p \bullet\; p \Less o \Imp \PDownward(p)
~

With $\Less$ as the usual ordering on ordinals, this equation satisfies the decrement
condition, but evaluating $\PDownward(\omega)$ would require evaluating
$\PDownward(n)$ for every natural number $n$.  However, what we are concerned
about here is to avoid mathematical inconsistencies, and that is
indeed a consequence of the decrement condition.

#### Example with Well-founded Functions {#sec-fib-example}

So that we can later see how inductive proofs are done in Dafny, let's prove that
for any $n$, $\fib(n)$ is even iff $n$ is a multiple of $3$.
We split our task into
two cases.  If $n < 2$, then the property follows directly from the definition
of $\fib$.  Otherwise, note that exactly one of the three numbers $n-2$, $n-1$, and $n$
is a multiple of 3.  If $n$ is the multiple of 3, then by invoking the
induction hypothesis on $n-2$
and $n-1$, we obtain that $\fib(n-2) + \fib(n-1)$ is the sum of two odd numbers,
which is even.  If $n-2$ or $n-1$ is a multiple of 3, then by invoking the induction
hypothesis on $n-2$ and $n-1$, we obtain that $\fib(n-2) + \fib(n-1)$ is the sum of an
even number and an odd number, which is odd.  In this proof, we invoked the induction
hypothesis on $n-2$ and on $n-1$.  This is allowed, because both are smaller than
$n$, and hence the invocations go down in the well-founded ordering on natural numbers.

### Extreme Solutions

We don't need to exclude the possibility of equation [#eq-general] having multiple
solutions---instead, we can just be clear about which one of them we want.
Let's explore this, after a smidgen of lattice theory.

For any complete lattice $(Y,\leq)$ and any set $X$, we can by _pointwise extension_ define
a complete lattice $(X \to Y, \FBelow)$, where for any $f,g \colon X \to Y$,

~ Equation
  f \FBelow q  \Equiv
  \forall x \bullet\; f(x) \leq g(x) 
~

In particular, if $Y$ is the set of booleans ordered by implication ($\false \leq \true$),
then the set of predicates over any domain $X$ forms a complete lattice.
Tarski's Theorem [@Tarski:theorem] tells us that any monotonic function over a
complete lattice has a least and a greatest fixpoint.  In particular, this means that
$\F$ has a least fixpoint and a greatest fixpoint, provided $\F$ is monotonic.

Speaking about the _set of solutions_ in $f$ to [#eq-general] is the same as speaking
about the _set of fixpoints_ of functor $\F$.  In particular, the least and greatest
solutions to [#eq-general] are the same as the least and greatest fixpoints of $\F$.
In casual speak, it happens that we say "fixpoint of [#eq-general]", or more
grotesquely, "fixpoint of $f$" when we really mean "fixpoint of $\F$".

In conclusion of our little excursion into lattice theory, we have that, under the
proviso of $\F$ being monotonic, the set of solutions in $f$ to [#eq-general] is nonempty,
and among these solutions, there is in the $\FBelow$ ordering a least solution (that is,
a function that returns $\false$ more often than any other) and a greatest solution (that
is, a function that returns $\true$ more often than any other).

When discussing extreme solutions, I will now restrict my attention to boolean functions
(that is, with $Y$ being the type of booleans).  Functor $\F$ is monotonic
if the calls to $f$ in $\F'(f)$ are in _positive positions_ (that is, under an even number
of negations).  Indeed, from now on, I will restrict my attention to such monotonic
functors $\F$.

Let me introduce a running example.  Consider the following equation,
where $x$ ranges over the integers:

~ Equation {#eq-EvenNat}
  g(x) \Equal (x = 0 \Or g(x-2))
~

This equation has four solutions in $g$.  With $w$ ranging over the integers, they are:

~ Equation
  \begin{array}{r@{}l}
  g(x) \Equiv{}&  x \in \{w \;|\; 0 \leq w \And w\textrm{ even}\} \\
  g(x) \Equiv{}&  x \in \{w \;|\; w\textrm{ even}\} \\
  g(x) \Equiv{}&  x \in \{w \;|\; (0 \leq w \And w\textrm{ even}) \Or w\textrm{ odd}\} \\
  g(x) \Equiv{}&  x \in \{w \;|\; \true\}
  \end{array}
~

The first of these is the least solution and the last is the greatest solution.

In the literature, the definition of an extreme predicate is often given as a set of
_inference rules_.  To designate the least solution, a single line separating the
antecedent (on top) from conclusion (on bottom) is used:

~ Equation {#g-ind-rule}
  \frac{}{g(0)}
  \qquad\qquad
  \frac{g(x-2)}{g(x)}
~

Through repeated applications of such rules, one can show that the predicate holds for
a particular value.  For example, the _derivation_, or _proof tree_,
to the left in Figure [#fig-proof-trees] shows that $g(6)$ holds.
(In this simple example, the derivation is a rather degenerate proof "tree".)
The use of these inference rules gives rise to a least solution, because proof trees are
accepted only if they are _finite_.

~ Begin Figure { #fig-proof-trees caption="Left: a finite proof tree that uses the rules of [#g-ind-rule] to establish $g(6)$.  Right: an infinite proof tree that uses the rules of [#g-coind-rule] to establish $g(1)$." }
~ Begin Columns
~~ Column { vertical-align=bottom }
~ Math
\dfrac{
  \dfrac{
    \dfrac{
      \dfrac{}{g(0)\xstrut}
      }{g(2)\xstrut}
    }{g(4)\xstrut}
  }{g(6)\xupstrut}
~
~~

        }{{g(-5)}}
      }{{g(-3)}}
    }{{g(-1)}}
  }{g(1)}
~
~~
~ End Columns
~ End Figure

When inference rules are to designate the greatest solution, a double
line is used:

~ Equation {#g-coind-rule}
  \Dfrac{}{g(0)}
  \qquad\qquad
  \Dfrac{g(x-2)}{g(x)}
~

In this case, proof trees are allowed to be infinite.  For example, the (partial depiction
of the) infinite proof tree on the right in Figure [#fig-proof-trees] shows that $g(1)$ holds.

Note that derivations may not be unique.  For example, in the case of the greatest
solution for $g$, there are two proof trees that establish $g(0)$:  one is the finite
proof tree that uses the left-hand rule of [#g-coind-rule] once, the other is the infinite
proof tree that keeps on using the right-hand rule of [#g-coind-rule].

### Working with Extreme Predicates

In general, one cannot evaluate whether or not an extreme predicate holds for some
input, because doing so may take an infinite number of steps.  For example, following
the recursive calls in the definition [#eq-EvenNat] to try to evaluate $g(7)$ would never
terminate.  However, there are useful ways to establish that an extreme predicate holds
and there are ways to make use of one once it has been established.

For any $\F$ as in [#eq-general], I define two infinite series of well-founded
functions, $\iter{f}_k$ and $\Iter{f}_k$
where $k$ ranges over the natural numbers:

~ Equation {#eq-least-approx}
  \iter{f}_k(x) \Equal \left\{
    \begin{array}{ll}
      \false         & \textrm{if } k = 0 \\
      \F(\iter{f}_{k-1})(x) & \textrm{if } k > 0
    \end{array}
    \right.
~ 
~ Equation {#eq-greatest-approx}
  \Iter{f}_k(x) \Equal \left\{
    \begin{array}{ll}
      \true          & \textrm{if } k = 0 \\
      \F(\Iter{f}_{k-1})(x) & \textrm{if } k > 0
    \end{array}
    \right.
~ 

These functions are called the _iterates_ of $f$, and I will also refer to them
as the _prefix predicates_ of $f$ (or the _prefix predicate_ of $f$, if we think
of $k$ as being a parameter).
Alternatively, we can define $\iter{f}_k$ and $\Iter{f}_k$ without mentioning $x$:
Let $\bot$ denote the function that always returns $\false$, let $\top$
denote the function that always returns $\true$, and let a superscript on $\F$ denote
exponentiation (for example, $\F^0(f) = f$ and $\F^2(f) = \F(\F(f))$).
Then, [#eq-least-approx] and [#eq-greatest-approx] can be stated equivalently as
$\iter{f}_k = \F^k(\bot)$ and $\Iter{f}_k = \F^k(\top)$.

For any solution $f$ to equation [#eq-general], we have, for any $k$ and $\ell$
such that $k \leq \ell$:

~ Equation {#eq-prefix-postfix}
  \iter{f}_k    \quad\FBelow\quad
  \iter{f}_\ell \quad\FBelow\quad
  f      \quad\FBelow\quad
  \Iter{f}_\ell \quad\FBelow\quad
  \Iter{f}_k
~

In other words, every $\iter{f}_k$ is a _pre-fixpoint_ of $f$ and every $\Iter{f}_k$ is a _post-fixpoint_
of $f$.  Next, I define two functions, $f\least$ and $f\greatest$, in
terms of the prefix predicates:

~ Equation {#eq-least-is-exists}
  f\least(x) \Equal  \exists k \bullet\; \iter{f}_k(x) 
~
~ Equation {#eq-greatest-is-forall}
  f\greatest(x) \Equal  \forall k \bullet\; \Iter{f}_k(x) 
~

By [#eq-prefix-postfix], we also have that $f\least$ is a pre-fixpoint of $\F$ and $f\greatest$
is a post-fixpoint of $\F$.  The marvelous thing is that, if $\F$ is _continuous_, then
$f\least$ and $f\greatest$ are the least and greatest fixpoints of $\F$.
These equations let us do proofs by induction when dealing with extreme predicates.
I will explain in Section [#sec-friendliness] how to check for continuity.

Let's consider two examples, both involving function $g$ in
[#eq-EvenNat].  As it turns out, $g$'s defining functor is continuous,
and therefore I will write $g\least$ and $g\greatest$ to denote the
least and greatest solutions for $g$ in [#eq-EvenNat].

#### Example with Least Solution {#sec-example-least-solution}

The main technique for establishing that $g\least(x)$ holds for some
$x$, that is, proving something of the form $Q \Imp g\least(x)$, is to
construct a proof tree like the one for $g(6)$ in Figure
[#fig-proof-trees].  For a proof in this direction, since we're just
applying the defining equation, the fact that
we're using a least solution for $g$ never plays a role (as long as we
limit ourselves to finite derivations).

The technique for going in the other direction, proving something _from_ an established
$g\least$ property, that is, showing something of the form $g\least(x) \Imp R$, typically
uses induction on the structure of the proof tree.  When the antecedent of our proof
obligation includes a predicate term $g\least(x)$, it is sound to
imagine that we have been given a proof tree for $g\least(x)$.  Such a proof tree
would be a data structure---to be more precise, a term in an
_inductive datatype_.
For this reason, least solutions like $g\least$ have been given the
name _inductive predicate_.

Let's prove $g\least(x) \Imp 0 \leq x \And x \textrm{ even}$.
We split our task into two cases, corresponding to which of the two
proof rules in [#g-ind-rule] was the
last one applied to establish $g\least(x)$.  If it was the left-hand rule, then $x=0$,
which makes it easy to establish the conclusion of our proof goal.  If it was the
right-hand rule, then we unfold the proof tree one level and obtain $g\least(x-2)$.
Since the proof tree for $g\least(x-2)$ is smaller than where we started, we invoke
the _induction hypothesis_ and obtain $0 \leq (x-2) \And (x-2) \textrm{ even}$, from which
it is easy to establish the conclusion of our proof goal.

Here's how we do the proof formally using [#eq-least-is-exists].  We massage the
general form of our proof goal:

|~~~|~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~|
|   | $f\greatest(x) \Imp R$                                                    |
| = | &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; { [#eq-least-is-exists] }                        |
|   | $(\exists k \bullet\; \iter{f}_k(x)) \Imp R$                              |
| = | &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; { distribute $\Imp$ over $\exists$ to the left } |
|   | $\forall k \bullet\; (\iter{f}_k(x) \Imp R)$                              |

The last line can be proved by induction over $k$.  So, in our case, we prove
$\iter{g}_k(x) \Imp 0 \leq x \And x \textrm{ even}$ for every $k$.
If $k=0$, then $\iter{g}_k(x)$ is $\false$, so our goal holds trivially.
If $k > 0$, then $\iter{g}_k(x) = (x = 0 \Or \iter{g}_{k-1}(x-2))$.  Our goal holds easily
for the first disjunct ($x=0$).  For the other disjunct,
we apply the induction hypothesis (on the smaller $k-1$ and with $x-2$) and
obtain $0 \leq (x-2) \And (x-2) \textrm{ even}$, from which our proof goal
follows.

#### Example with Greatest Solution {#sec-example-greatest-solution}

We can think of a given predicate $g\greatest(x)$ as being represented
by a proof tree---in this case a term in a _coinductive datatype_,
since the proof may be infinite.
For this reason, greatest solutions like $g\greatest$ have
been given the name _coinductive predicate_, or _co-predicate_ for short.
The main technique for proving something from a given proof tree, that
is, to prove something of the form $g\greatest(x) \Imp R$, is to
destruct the proof.  Since this is just unfolding the defining
equation, the fact that we're using a greatest solution for $g$ never
plays a role (as long as we limit ourselves to a finite number of
unfoldings).

To go in the other direction, to establish a predicate defined as a greatest solution,
like $Q \Imp g\greatest(x)$, we may need an infinite number of steps.  For this purpose,
we can use induction's dual, _coinduction_.  Were it not for one little detail, coinduction
is as simple as continuations in programming: the next part of the proof obligation
is delegated to the _coinduction hypothesis_.  The little detail is making sure that
it is the "next" part we're passing on for the continuation, not the same part.  This
detail is called _productivity_ and corresponds to the requirement in
induction of making sure we're going down a well-founded relation when
applying the induction hypothesis.  There are
many sources with more information, see for example the classic account by
Jacobs and Rutten [@JacobsRutten:IntroductionCoalgebra]
or a new attempt by Kozen and Silva
that aims to emphasize the simplicity, not the mystery, of
coinduction [@KozenSilva:Coinduction].

Let's prove $\true \Imp g\greatest(x)$.  The intuitive coinductive proof goes like this:
According to the right-hand rule of [#g-coind-rule], $g\greatest(x)$ follows if we
establish $g\greatest(x-2)$, and that's easy to do by invoking the coinduction hypothesis.
The "little detail", productivity, is satisfied in this proof because we applied
a rule in [#g-coind-rule] before invoking the coinduction hypothesis.

For anyone who may have felt that the intuitive proof felt too easy, here is a formal
proof using [#eq-greatest-is-forall], which relies only on induction.  We massage the
general form of our proof goal:

|~~~|~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~|
|   | $Q \Imp f\greatest(x)$                                                      |
| = | &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  { [#eq-greatest-is-forall] }                      |
|   | $Q \Imp \forall k \bullet\; \Iter{f}_k(x)$                                  |
| = | &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  { distribute $\Imp$ over $\forall$ to the right } |
|   | $\forall k \bullet\; Q \Imp \Iter{f}_k(x)$                                  |

The last line can be proved by induction over $k$.  So, in our case, we prove
$\true \Imp \Iter{g}_k(x)$ for every $k$.
If $k=0$, then $\Iter{g}_k(x)$ is $\true$, so our goal holds trivially.
If $k > 0$, then $\Iter{g}_k(x) = (x = 0 \Or \Iter{g}_{k-1}(x-2))$.  We establish the second
disjunct by applying the induction hypothesis (on the smaller $k-1$ and with $x-2$).

### Other Techniques

Although in this paper I consider only well-founded functions and extreme
predicates, it is worth mentioning that there are additional ways of making sure that
the set of solutions to [#eq-general] is nonempty.  For example, if all calls to $f$ in
$\F'(f)$ are _tail-recursive calls_, then (under the assumption that $Y$ is nonempty) the set of
solutions is nonempty.  To see this, consider an attempted evaluation of $f(x)$ that fails
to determine a definite result value because of an infinite chain of calls that applies $f$
to each value of some subset $X'$ of $X$.  Then, apparently, the value of $f$ for any one
of the values in $X'$ is not determined by the equation, but picking any particular result
values for these makes for a consistent definition.
This was pointed out by Manolios and Moore [@ManoliosMoore:PartialFunctions].
Functions can be underspecified in this way in the proof assistants ACL2 [@ACL2:book]
and HOL [@Krauss:PhD].

## Functions in Dafny

In this section, I explain with examples the support in
Dafny[^fn-on-da-web] for well-founded functions, extreme predicates,
and proofs regarding these.

[^fn-on-da-web]: Dafny is open source at [dafny.codeplex.com](http://dafny.codeplex.com) and can also be used online at [rise4fun.com/dafny](http://rise4fun.com/dafny).

### Well-founded Functions in Dafny

Declarations of well-founded functions are unsurprising.  For example, the Fibonacci
function is declared as follows:

```
function fib(n: nat): nat
{
  if n < 2 then n else fib(n-2) + fib(n-1)
}
```

Dafny verifies that the body (given as an expression in curly braces) is well defined.
This includes decrement checks for recursive (and mutually recursive) calls.  Dafny
predefines a well-founded relation on each type and extends it to lexicographic tuples
of any (fixed) length.  For example, the well-founded relation $x \Less y$ for integers
is $x < y \And 0 \leq y$, the one for reals is $x \leq y - 1.0 \And 0.0 \leq y$
(this is the same ordering as for integers, if you read the integer
relation as $x \leq y - 1 \And 0 \leq y$), the one for inductive
datatypes is structural inclusion,
and the one for coinductive datatypes is $\false$.

Using a `decreases` clause, the programmer can specify the term in this predefined
order.  When a function definition omits a `decreases` clause, Dafny makes a simple
guess.  This guess (which can be inspected by hovering over the function name in the
Dafny IDE) is very often correct, so users are rarely bothered to provide explicit
`decreases` clauses.

If a function returns `bool`, one can drop the result type `: bool` and change the
keyword `function` to `predicate`.

### Proofs in Dafny

Dafny has `lemma` declarations.  These are really just special cases of methods:
they can have pre- and postcondition specifications and their body is a code block.
Here is the lemma we stated and proved in Section [#sec-fib-example]:

```
lemma FibProperty(n: nat)
  ensures fib(n) % 2 == 0 <==> n % 3 == 0
{
  if n < 2 {
  } else {
    FibProperty(n-2); FibProperty(n-1);
  }
}
```

The postcondition of this lemma (keyword `ensures`) gives the proof
goal.  As in any program-correctness logic (e.g.,
[@Hoare:AxiomaticBasis]), the postcondition must
be established on every control path through the lemma's body.  For
`FibProperty`, I give the proof by
an `if` statement, hence introducing a case split.  The then branch is empty, because
Dafny can prove the postcondition automatically in this case.  The else branch
performs two recursive calls to the lemma.  These are the invocations of the induction
hypothesis and they follow the usual program-correctness rules,
namely: the precondition must hold at the call site, the call must terminate, and then
the caller gets to assume the postcondition upon return.  The "proof glue" needed
to complete the proof is done automatically by Dafny.

Dafny features an aggregate statement using which it is possible to make (possibly
infinitely) many calls at once.  For example, the induction hypothesis can be called
at once on all values `n'` smaller than `n`:

```
forall n' | 0 <= n' < n {
  FibProperty(n');
}
```

For our purposes, this corresponds to _strong induction_.  More
generally, the `forall` statement has the form

```
forall k | P(k)
  ensures Q(k)
{ Statements; }
```

Logically, this statement corresponds to _universal introduction_: the body proves that
`Q(k)` holds for an arbitrary `k` such that `P(k)`, and the conclusion of the `forall` statement
is then $\forall k \bullet\; P(k) \Imp Q(k)$.  When the body of the `forall` statement is
a single call (or `calc` statement), the `ensures` clause is inferred and can be omitted,
like in our `FibProperty` example.

Lemma `FibProperty` is simple enough that its whole body can be replaced by the one
`forall` statement above.  In fact, Dafny goes one step further: it automatically
inserts such a `forall` statement at the beginning of every lemma [@Leino:induction].
Thus, `FibProperty` can be declared and proved simply by:

``` {.para-end}
lemma FibProperty(n: nat)
  ensures fib(n) % 2 == 0 <==> n % 3 == 0
{ }
```

Going in the other direction from universal introduction is existential elimination,
also known as Skolemization.  Dafny has a statement for this, too:
for any variable `x` and boolean expression `Q`, the
_assign such that_ statement `x :| Q;` says to assign to `x` a value such that `Q`
will hold.  A proof obligation when using this statement is to show that there
exists an `x` such that `Q` holds.  For example, if the fact
$\exists k \bullet\; 100 \leq \fib(k) < 200$ is known, then the statement
`k :| 100 <= fib(k) < 200;` will assign to `k` some value (chosen arbitrarily)
for which `fib(k)` falls in the given range.

### Extreme Predicates in Dafny {#sec-friendliness}

In this previous subsection, I explained that a `predicate` declaration introduces a
well-founded predicate.  The declarations for introducing extreme predicates are
`inductive predicate` and `copredicate`.  Here is the definition of the least and
greatest solutions of $g$ from above, let's call them `g` and `G`:

```
inductive predicate g(x: int) { x == 0 || g(x-2) }
copredicate G(x: int) { x == 0 || G(x-2) }
```

When Dafny receives either of these definitions, it automatically declares the corresponding
prefix predicates.  Instead of the names $\iter{g}_k$ and $\Iter{g}_k$ that I used above, Dafny
names the prefix predicates `g#[k]` and `G#[k]`, respectively, that is, the name of
the extreme predicate appended with `#`, and the subscript is given as an argument in
square brackets.  The definition of the prefix predicate derives from the body of
the extreme predicate and follows the form in [#eq-least-approx] and [#eq-greatest-approx].
Using a faux-syntax for illustrative purposes, here are the prefix
predicates that Dafny defines automatically from the extreme
predicates `g` and `G`:

```
predicate g#[_k: nat](x: int) { _k != 0 && (x == 0 || g#[_k-1](x-2)) }
predicate G#[_k: nat](x: int) { _k != 0 ==> (x == 0 || G#[_k-1](x-2)) }
```

The Dafny verifier is aware of the connection between extreme predicates and their
prefix predicates, [#eq-least-is-exists] and [#eq-greatest-is-forall].

Remember that to be well defined, the defining functor of an extreme predicate
must be monotonic, and for [#eq-least-is-exists] and [#eq-greatest-is-forall] to hold,
the functor must be continuous.  Dafny enforces the former of these by checking that
recursive calls of extreme predicates are in positive positions.  The continuity
requirement comes down to checking that they are also in _continuous positions_:
that recursive calls to inductive predicates are
not inside unbounded universal quantifiers and that recursive calls to co-predicates
are not inside unbounded existential quantifiers [@Milner:CCS; @LeinoMoskal:Coinduction].

### Proofs about Extreme Predicates

From what I have presented so far, we can do the formal proofs from Sections
[#sec-example-least-solution] and [#sec-example-greatest-solution].  Here is the
former:

```
lemma EvenNat(x: int)
  requires g(x)
  ensures 0 <= x && x % 2 == 0
{
  var k: nat :| g#[k](x);
  EvenNatAux(k, x);
}
lemma EvenNatAux(k: nat, x: int)
  requires g#[k](x)
  ensures 0 <= x && x % 2 == 0
{
  if x == 0 { } else { EvenNatAux(k-1, x-2); }
}
```

Lemma `EvenNat` states the property we wish to prove.  From its
precondition (keyword `requires`) and
[#eq-least-is-exists], we know there is some `k` that will make the condition in the
assign-such-that statement true.  Such a value is then assigned to `k` and passed to
the auxiliary lemma, which promises to establish the proof goal.  Given the condition
`g#[k](x)`, the definition of `g#` lets us conclude `k != 0` as well as the disjunction
`x == 0 || g#[k-1](x-2)`.  The then branch considers the case of the first disjunct,
from which the proof goal follows automatically.  The else branch can then assume
`g#[k-1](x-2)` and calls the induction hypothesis with those parameters.  The proof
glue that shows the proof goal for `x` to follow from the proof goal with `x-2` is
done automatically.

Because Dafny automatically inserts the statement

```
forall k', x' | 0 <= k' < k && g#[k'](x') {
  EvenNatAux(k', x');
}
```

at the beginning of the body of `EvenNatAux`, the body can be left empty and Dafny
completes the proof automatically.

Here is the Dafny program that gives the proof from Section [#sec-example-greatest-solution]:

``` {.para-end}
lemma Always(x: int)
  ensures G(x)
{ forall k: nat { AlwaysAux(k, x); } }
lemma AlwaysAux(k: nat, x: int)
  ensures G#[k](x)
{ }
```

While each of these proofs involves only basic proof rules, the setup feels a bit clumsy,
even with the empty body of the auxiliary lemmas.  Moreover,
the proofs do not reflect the intuitive proofs I described in
Section [#sec-example-least-solution] and [#sec-example-greatest-solution].
These shortcoming are addressed in the next subsection.

### Nicer Proofs of Extreme Predicates

The proofs we just saw follow standard forms:
use Skolemization to convert the inductive predicate into a prefix predicate for some `k`
and then do the proof inductively over `k`; respectively,
by induction over `k`, prove the prefix predicate for every `k`, then use
universal introduction to convert to the coinductive predicate.
With the declarations `inductive lemma` and `colemma`, Dafny offers to
set up the proofs
in these standard forms.  What is gained is not just fewer characters in the program
text, but also a possible intuitive reading of the proofs.  (Okay, to be fair, the
reading is intuitive for simpler proofs; complicated proofs may or may not be intuitive.) 

Somewhat analogous to the creation of prefix predicates from extreme predicates, Dafny
automatically creates a _prefix lemma_ `L#` from each "extreme lemma" `L`.  The pre-
and postconditions of a prefix lemma are copied from those of the extreme lemma,
except for the following replacements:
For an inductive lemma, Dafny looks in the precondition to find calls (in positive, continuous
positions) to inductive predicates `P(x)` and replaces these with `P#[_k](x)`.
For a
co-lemma, Dafny looks in the postcondition to find calls (in positive, continuous positions)
to co-predicates `P` (including equality among coinductive datatypes, which is a built-in
co-predicate) and replaces these with `P#[_k](x)`.
In each case, these predicates `P` are the lemma's _focal predicates_.

The body of the extreme lemma is moved to the prefix lemma, but with
replacing each recursive
call `L(x)` with `L#[_k-1](x)` and replacing each occurrence of a call
to a focal predicate
`P(x)` with `P#[_k-1](x)`.  The bodies of the extreme lemmas are then replaced as shown
in the previous subsection.  By construction, this new body correctly leads to the
extreme lemma's postcondition.

Let us see what effect these rewrites have on how one can write proofs.  Here are the proofs
of our running example:

```
inductive lemma EvenNat(x: int)
  requires g(x)
  ensures 0 <= x && x % 2 == 0
{ if x == 0 { } else { EvenNat(x-2); } }
colemma Always(x: int)
  ensures G(x)
{ Always(x-2); }
```

Both of these proofs follow the intuitive proofs given in Sections
[#sec-example-least-solution] and [#sec-example-greatest-solution].  Note that in these
simple examples, the user is never bothered with either prefix predicates nor
prefix lemmas---the proofs just look like "what you'd expect".

Since Dafny automatically inserts calls to the induction hypothesis at the beginning of
each lemma, the bodies of the given extreme lemmas `EvenNat` and
`Always` can be empty and Dafny still completes the proofs.
Folks, it doesn't get any simpler than that!

# Class Types

````
ClassDecl = "class" { Attribute } ClassName [ GenericParameters ]
  ["extends" Type {"," Type} ] 
  "{" { { DeclModifier } ClassMemberDecl(moduleLevelDecl: false) } "}" 
````

````
ClassMemberDecl(moduleLevelDecl) = 
  ( FieldDecl | FunctionDecl | 
    MethodDecl(isGhost: ("ghost" was present), 
               allowConstructor: !moduleLevelDecl) 
  ) 
````
The ``ClassMemberDecl`` parameter `moduleLevelDecl` will be true if 
the member declaration is at the top level or directly within a 
module declaration. It will be false for ``ClassMemberDecl``s
that are part of a class or trait declaration. If `moduleLevelDecl` is
false ``FieldDecl``s are not allowed.

A _class_ `C` is a reference type declared as follows:
```
class C<T> extends J1, ..., Jn
{
  \(_members_\)
}
```
where the list of type parameters `T` is optional and so is
"`extends J1, ..., Jn`", which says that the class extends traits `J1` ... `Jn`.
The members of a class are _fields_, _functions_, and
_methods_.  These are accessed or invoked by dereferencing a reference
to a `C` instance. 

A function or method is invoked on an _instance_
of `C`, unless the function or method is declared `static`.
A function or method that is not `static` is called an
_instance_ function or method.

An instance function or method takes an implicit _receiver_
parameter, namely, the instance used to access the member.  In the
specification and body of an instance function or method, the receiver
parameter can be referred to explicitly by the keyword `this`.
However, in such places, members of `this` can also be mentioned
without any qualification.  To illustrate, the qualified `this.f` and
the unqualified `f` refer to the same field of the same object in the
following example:
```
class C {
  var f: int
  method Example() returns (b: bool)
  {
    b := f == this.f;
  }
}
```
so the method body always assigns `true` to the out-parameter `b`.
There is no semantic difference between qualified and
unqualified accesses to the same receiver and member.

A `C` instance is created using `new`, for example:
```
c := new C;
```

Note that `new` simply allocates a `C` object and returns a reference
to it; the initial values of its fields are arbitrary values of their
respective types.  Therefore, it is common to invoke a method, known
as an _initialization method_, immediately after creation, for
example:
```
c := new C;
c.InitFromList(xs, 3);
```
When an initialization method has no out-parameters and modifies no
more than `this`, then the two statements above can be combined into
one:
```
c := new C.InitFromList(xs, 3);
```
Note that a class can contain several initialization methods, that
these methods can be invoked at any time, not just as part of a `new`,
and that `new` does not require that an initialization method be
invoked at creation.

A clas can declare special initializing methods called _constructor methods_. 
See Section [#sec-method-declarations].

## Field Declarations
````
FieldDecl = "var" { Attribute } FIdentType { "," FIdentType }
````
An ``FIdentType`` is used to declare a field. The field name is either an
identifier (that is not allowed to start with a leading underscore) or
some digits. Digits are used if you want to number your fields, e.g. "0",
"1", etc.
````
FIdentType = ( FieldIdent | digits ) ":" Type 
````

A field x of some type T is declared as:
```
var x: T
```

A field declaration declares one or more fields of the enclosing class.
Each field is a named part of the state of an object of that class. A
field declaration is similar to but distinct from a variable declaration
statement. Unlike for local variables and bound variables, the type is
required and will not be inferred.

Unlike method and function declarations, a field declaration
cannot be given at the top level. Fields can be declared in either a
class or a trait. A class that inherits from multiple traits will 
have all the fields declared in any of its parent traits.

Fields that are declared as `ghost` can only be used in specifications,
not in code that will be compiled into executable code.

Fields may not be declared static.

`protected` is not allowed for fields.

## Method Declarations
````
MethodDecl(isGhost, allowConstructor) = 
 MethodKeyword { Attribute } [ MethodName ]
 (  MethodSignature(isGhost)  | SignatureEllipsis_ )
 MethodSpec [ BlockStmt ]
````
The `isGhost` parameter is true iff the `ghost` keyword
preceded the method declaration.

If the `allowConstructor` parameter is false then
the ``MethodDecl`` must not be a `constructor` 
declaration.

````
MethodKeyword = ("method" | "lemma" | "colemma"
                | "inductive" "lemma" | "constructor" )
````
The method keyword is used to specify special kinds of methods 
as explained below.

````
MethodSignature(isGhost) = 
    [ GenericParameters ] 
    Formals(allowGhost: !isGhost) 
    [ "returns" Formals(allowGhost: !isGhost) ]
````
A method signature specifies the method generic parameters,
input parameters and return parameters.
The formal parameters are not allowed to have `ghost` specified
if `ghost` was already specified for the method.

````
SignatureEllipsis_ = "..."
````
A ``SignatureEllipsis_`` is used when a method or function is being redeclared
in module that refines another module. In that case the signature is
copied from the module that is being refined. This works because
Dafny does not support method or function overloading, so the
name of the class method uniquely identifies it without the 
signature.

````
Formals(allowGhostKeyword) = 
  "(" [ GIdentType(allowGhostKeyword) 
        { "," GIdentType(allowGhostKeyword) } ] ")" 
````
The ``Formals`` specifies the names and types of the method input or
output parameters.

See section [#sec-method-specification] for a description of ``MethodSpec``.

A method declaration adheres to the ``MethodDecl`` grammar above.
Here is an example of a method declaration.

```
method {:att1}{:att2} M<T1, T2>(a: A, b: B, c: C) returns (x: X, y: Y, z: Z)
  requires Pre
  modifies Frame
  ensures Post
  decreases Rank
{
  Body
}
```

where `:att1` and `:att2` are attributes of the method,
`T1` and `T2` are type parameters of the method (if generic),
`a, b, c` are the method’s in-parameters, `x, y, z` are the
method’s out-parameters, `Pre` is a boolean expression denoting the
method’s precondition, `Frame` denotes a set of objects whose fields may
be updated by the method, `Post` is a boolean expression denoting the
method’s postcondition, `Rank` is the method’s variant function, and
`Body` is a statement that implements the method. `Frame` can be a list
of expressions, each of which is a set of objects or a single object, the
latter standing for the singleton set consisting of that one object. The
method’s frame is the union of these sets, plus the set of objects
allocated by the method body. For example, if `c` and `d` are parameters
of a class type `C`, then

```
modifies {c, d}

modifies {c} + {d}

modifies c, {d}

modifies c, d
```

all mean the same thing.

A method can be declared as ghost by preceding the declaration with the
keyword ghost. By default, a method has an implicit receiver parameter,
this. This parameter can be removed by preceding the method declaration
with the keyword static. A static method M in a class C can be invoked by
C.M(…).

In a class, a method can be declared to be a constructor method by
replacing the keyword `method` with the keyword `constructor`. A constructor
can only be called at the time an object is allocated (see
object-creation examples below), and for a class that contains one or
more constructors, object creation must be done in conjunction with a
call to a constructor.

An ordinary method is declared with the `method` keyword.
Section [#sec-constructors] explains methods that instead use the
`constructor` keyword. Section [#sec-lemmas] discusses methods that are
declared with the `lemma` keyword. Methods declared with the `inductive`
`lemma` keywords are discussed later in the context of inductive
predicates (see [#sec-inductive-datatypes]). Methods declared with the
`colemma` keyword are discussed later in the context of co-inductive
types, in section [#sec-colemmas].

A method without is body is _abstract_. A method is allowed to be
abstract under the following circumstances:

* It contains an `{:axiom}` attribute
* It contains an `{:imported}` attribute
* It contains a `{:decl}` attribute
* It is a declaration in an abstract module.
Note that when there is no body, Dafny assumes that the *ensures*
clauses are true without proof.

### Constructors
To write structured object-oriented programs, one often relies on that
objects are constructed only in certain ways.  For this purpose, Dafny
provides _constructor (method)s_, which are a restricted form of
initialization methods.  A constructor is declared with the keyword
`constructor` instead of `method`.  When a class contains a
constructor, every call to `new` for that class must be accompanied
with a call to one of the constructors.  Moreover, a constructor
cannot be called at other times, only during object creation.  Other
than these restrictions, there is no semantic difference between using
ordinary initialization methods and using constructors.

The Dafny design allows the constructors to be named, which promotes
using names like `InitFromList` above.  Still, many classes have just
one constructor or have a typical constructor.  Therefore, Dafny
allows one _anonymous constructor_, that is, a constructor whose name
is essentially "".  For example:
```
class Item {
  constructor (x: int, y: int)
  // ...
}
```
When invoking this constructor, the "`.`" is dropped, as in:
```
m := new Item(45, 29);
```
Note that an anonymous constructor is just one way to name a
constructor; there can be other constructors as well.

### Lemmas
Sometimes there are steps of logic required to prove a program correct,
but they are too complex for Dafny to discover and use on its own. When
this happens, we can often give Dafny assistance by providing a lemma.
This is done by declaring a method with the `lemma` keyword.
Lemmas are implicitly ghost methods and the `ghost` keyword cannot
be applied to them.

For an example, see the `FibProperty` lemma in
Section [#sec-proofs-in-dafny].

See [the Dafny Lemmas tutorial](http://rise4fun.com/Dafny/tutorial/Lemmas)
for more examples and hints for using lemmas.

## Function Declarations

````
FunctionDecl = 
  ( "function" [ "method" ] { Attribute }
    FunctionName 
    FunctionSignatureOrEllipsis_(allowGhostKeyword: ("method" present))
  | "predicate" [ "method" ] { Attribute }
    PredicateName 
    PredicateSignatureOrEllipsis_(allowGhostKeyword: ("method" present))
  | "inductive" "predicate" { Attribute }
    PredicateName 
    PredicateSignatureOrEllipsis_(allowGhostKeyword: false)
  | "copredicate" { Attribute }
    CopredicateName 
    PredicateSignatureOrEllipsis_(allowGhostKeyword: false)
  )
  FunctionSpec [ FunctionBody ] 

FunctionSignatureOrEllipsis_(allowGhostKeyword) =
    FunctionSignature_ | SignatureEllipsis_ 
FunctionSignature_(allowGhostKeyword) =
    [ GenericParameters ] Formals(allowGhostKeyword) ":" Type 

PredicateSignatureOrEllipsis_(allowGhostKeyword) =
    PredicateSignature_(allowGhostKeyword) | SignatureEllipsis_ 
PredicateSignature_(allowGhostKeyword) =
    [ GenericParameters ] Formals(allowGhostKeyword)

FunctionBody = "{" Expression(allowLemma: true, allowLambda: true) "}" 
````
In the above productions, allowGhostKeyword is true if the optional
"method" keyword was specified. This allows some of the
formal parameters of a function method to be specified as ghost.

See section [#sec-function-specification] for a description of ``FunctionSpec``.

A Dafny function is a pure mathematical function. It is allowed to
read memory that was specified in its `reads` expression but is not
allowed to have any side effects.

Here is an example function declaration:
```
function {:att1}{:att2} F<T1, T2>(a: A, b: B, c: C): T
  requires Pre
  reads Frame
  ensures Post
  decreases Rank
{
  Body
}
```

where `:att1` and `:att2` are attributes of the function, if any, `T1`
and `T2` are type parameters of the function (if generic), `a, b, c` are
the functions’s parameters, `T` is the type of the function’s result,
`Pre` is a boolean expression denoting the function’s precondition,
`Frame` denotes a set of objects whose fields the function body may
depend on, `Post` is a boolean expression denoting the function’s
postcondition, `Rank` is the function’s variant function, and `Body` is
an expression that defines the function return value. The precondition
allows a function to be partial, that is, the precondition says when the
function is defined (and Dafny will verify that every use of the function
meets the precondition). The postcondition is usually not needed, since
the body of the function gives the full definition. However, the
postcondition can be a convenient place to declare properties of the
function that may require an inductive proof to establish. For example:

````
function Factorial(n: int): int
  requires 0 <= n
  ensures 1 <= Factorial(n)
{
  if n == 0 then 1 else Factorial(n-1) * n
}
````

says that the result of Factorial is always positive, which Dafny
verifies inductively from the function body. To refer to the function’s
result in the postcondition, use the function itself, as shown in the
example.

By default, a function is *ghost*, and cannot be called from non-ghost
code. To make it non-ghost, replace the keyword function with the two
keywords "function method".

By default, a function has an implicit receiver parameter, `this`. This
parameter can be removed by preceding the function declaration with the
keyword `static`. A static function `F` in a class `C` can be invoked
by `C.F(…)`. This can give a convenient way to declare a number of helper
functions in a separate class.

As for methods, a ``SignatureEllipsis_`` is used when declaring
a function in a module refinement. For example, if module `M0` declares
function `F`, a module `M1` can be declared to refine `M0` and
`M1` can then refine `F`. The refinement function, `M1.F` can have
a ``SignatureEllipsis_`` which means to copy the signature form 
`M0.F`. A refinement function can furnish a body for a function
(if `M0.F` does not provide one). It can also add **ensures** 
clauses. And if `F` is a predicate, it can add conjuncts to 
a previously given body.

### Function Transparency 
A function is said to be _transparent_ in a location if the 
contents of the body of the function is visible at that point.
A function is said to be _opaque_ at a location if it is not 
transparent. However the ``FunctionSpec`` of a function
is always available.

A function is usually transparent up to some unrolling level (up to
1, or maybe 2 or 3). If its arguments are all literals it is
transparent all the way.

But the transparency of a function is affected by the following:

* whether the function was declared to be protected, and 
* whether the function was given the `{:opaque}` attribute (as explained
in Section [#sec-opaque]).

The following table summarizes where the function is transparent.
The module referenced in the table is the module in which the
function is defined.

+------------+--------------+-------------+-------------+
| Protected? | `{:opaque}`? | Transparent | Transparent |
|            |              | Inside      | Outside     |
|            |              | Module      | Module      |
+:----------:+:------------:+:-----------:+:-----------:+
| N          | N            | Y           | Y           |
| Y          | N            | Y           | N           |
| N          | Y            | N           | N           |
+------------+--------------+-------------+-------------+

When `{:opaque}` is specified for function `g`, `g` is opaque,
however the lemma `reveal_g` is available to give the semantics
of `g` whether in the defining module or outside.

It currently is not allowed to have both `protected` and
`{:opaque}` specified for a function.

### Predicates
A function that returns a `bool` results is called a _predicate_. As an
alternative syntax, a predicate can be declared by replacing the `function`
keyword with the `predicate` keyword and omitting a declaration of the
return type.

### Inductive Predicates and Lemmas
See section [#sec-friendliness] for descriptions
of inductive predicates and lemmas.

# Trait Types
````
TraitDecl = "trait" { Attribute } TraitName [ GenericParameters ]
  "{" { { DeclModifier } ClassMemberDecl(moduleLevelDecl: false) } "}" 
````

A _trait_ is an "abstract superclass", or call it an "interface" or
"mixin".  Traits are new to Dafny and are likely to evolve for a
while.

The declaration of a trait is much like that of a class:
```
trait J
{
  \(_members_\)
}
```
where `\(_members_\)` can include fields, functions, and methods, but
no constructor methods.  The functions and methods are allowed to be
declared `static`.

A reference type `C` that extends a trait `J` is assignable to `J`, but
not the other way around.  The members of `J` are available as members
of `C`.  A member in `J` is not allowed to be redeclared in `C`,
except if the member is a non-`static` function or method without a
body in `J`.  By doing so, type `C` can supply a stronger
specification and a body for the member.

`new` is not allowed to be used with traits.  Therefore, there is no
object whose allocated type is a trait.  But there can of course be
objects of a class `C` that implements a trait `J`, and a reference to
such a `C` object can be used as a value of type `J`.

As an example, the following trait represents movable geometric shapes:
```
trait Shape
{
  function method Width(): real
    reads this
  method Move(dx: real, dy: real)
    modifies this
  method MoveH(dx: real)
    modifies this
  {
    Move(dx, 0.0);
  }
}
```
Members `Width` and `Move` are _abstract_ (that is, body less) and can
be implemented differently by different classes that extend the trait.
The implementation of method `MoveH` is given in the trait and thus
gets used by all classes that extend `Shape`.  Here are two classes
that each extends `Shape`:
```
class UnitSquare extends Shape
{
  var x: real, y: real
  function method Width(): real {  // note the empty reads clause
    1.0
  }
  method Move(dx: real, dy: real)
    modifies this
  {
    x, y := x + dx, y + dy;
  }
}
class LowerRightTriangle extends Shape
{
  var xNW: real, yNW: real, xSE: real, ySE: real
  function method Width(): real
    reads this
  {
    xSE - xNW
  }
  method Move(dx: real, dy: real)
    modifies this
  {
    xNW, yNW, xSE, ySE := xNW + dx, yNW + dy, xSE + dx, ySE + dy;
  }
}
```
Note that the classes can declare additional members, that they supply
implementations for the abstract members of the trait,
that they repeat the member signatures, and that they are responsible
for providing their own member specifications that both strengthen the
corresponding specification in the trait and are satisfied by the
provided body.
Finally, here is some code that creates two class instances and uses
them together as shapes:
```
var myShapes: seq<Shape>;
var A := new UnitSquare;
myShapes := [A];
var tri := new LowerRightTriangle;
// myShapes contains two Shape values, of different classes
myShapes := myShapes + [tri];
// move shape 1 to the right by the width of shape 0
myShapes[1].MoveH(myShapes[0].Width());
```

# Array Types
````
ArrayType_ = arrayToken [ GenericInstantiation ] 
````

Dafny supports mutable fixed-length _array types_ of any positive
dimension.  Array types are reference types.

## One-dimensional arrays

A one-dimensional array of `n` `T` elements is created as follows:
```
a := new T[n];
```
The initial values of the array elements are arbitrary values of type
`T`.
The length of an array is retrieved using the immutable `Length`
member.  For example, the array allocated above satisfies:
```
a.Length == n
```

For any integer-based numeric `i` in the range `0 <= i < a.Length`,
the _array selection_ expression `a[i]` retrieves element `i` (that
is, the element preceded by `i` elements in the array).  The
element stored at `i` can be changed to a value `t` using the array
update statement:
```
a[i] := t;
```

Caveat: The type of the array created by `new T[n]` is
`array<T>`.  A mistake that is simple to make and that can lead to
befuddlement is to write `array<T>` instead of `T` after `new`.
For example, consider the following:
```
var a := new array<T>;
var b := new array<T>[n];
var c := new array<T>(n);  // resolution error
var d := new array(n);  // resolution error
```
The first statement allocates an array of type `array<T>`, but of
unknown length.  The second allocates an array of type
`array<array<T>>` of length `n`, that is, an array that holds `n`
values of type `array<T>`.  The third statement allocates an
array of type `array<T>` and then attempts to invoke an anonymous
constructor on this array, passing argument `n`.  Since `array` has no
constructors, let alone an anonymous constructor, this statement
gives rise to an error.  If the type-parameter list is omitted for a
type that expects type parameters, Dafny will attempt to fill these
in, so as long as the `array` type parameter can be inferred, it is
okay to leave off the "`<T>`" in the fourth statement above.  However,
as with the third statement, `array` has no anonymous constructor, so
an error message is generated.

One-dimensional arrays support operations that convert a stretch of
consecutive elements into a sequence.  For any array `a` of type
`array<T>`, integer-based numerics `lo` and `hi` satisfying
`0 <= lo <= hi <= a.Length`, the following operations each yields a
`seq<T>`:

+---------------------+------------------------------------+
| expression          | description                        |
+---------------------+------------------------------------+
| `a[lo..hi]`         | subarray conversion to sequence    |
| `a[lo..]`           | drop                               |
| `a[..hi]`           | take                               |
| `a[..]`             | array conversion to sequence       |
+---------------------+------------------------------------+

The expression `a[lo..hi]` takes the first `hi` elements of the array,
then drops the first `lo` elements thereof and returns what remains as
a sequence.  The resulting sequence thus has length `hi - lo`.
The other operations are special instances of the first.  If `lo` is
omitted, it defaults to `0` and if `hi` is omitted, it defaults to
`a.Length`.
In the last operation, both `lo` and `hi` have been omitted, thus
`a[..]` returns the sequence consisting of all the array elements of
`a`.

The subarray operations are especially useful in specifications.  For
example, the loop invariant of a binary search algorithm that uses
variables `lo` and `hi` to delimit the subarray where the search `key`
may be still found can be expressed as follows:
```
key !in a[..lo] && key !in a[hi..]
```
Another use is to say that a certain range of array elements have not
been changed since the beginning of a method:
```
a[lo..hi] == old(a[lo..hi])
```
or since the beginning of a loop:
```
ghost var prevElements := a[..];
while // ...
  invariant a[lo..hi] == prevElements[lo..hi]
{
  // ...
}
```
Note that the type of `prevElements` in this example is `seq<T>`, if
`a` has type `array<T>`.

A final example of the subarray operation lies in expressing that an
array's elements are a permutation of the array's elements at the
beginning of a method, as would be done in most sorting algorithms.
Here, the subarray operation is combined with the sequence-to-multiset
conversion:
```
multiset(a[..]) == multiset(old(a[..]))
```

## Multi-dimensional arrays

An array of 2 or more dimensions is mostly like a one-dimensional
array, except that `new` takes more length arguments (one for each
dimension), and the array selection expression and the array update
statement take more indices.  For example:
```
matrix := new T[m, n];
matrix[i, j], matrix[x, y] := matrix[x, y], matrix[i, j];
```
create a 2-dimensional array whose dimensions have lengths `m` and
`n`, respectively, and then swaps the elements at `i,j` and `x,y`.
The type of `matrix` is `array2<T>`, and similarly for
higher-dimensional arrays (`array3<T>`, `array4<T>`, etc.).  Note,
however, that there is no type `array0<T>`, and what could have been
`array1<T>` is actually named just `array<T>`.

The `new` operation above requires `m` and `n` to be non-negative
integer-based numerics.  These lengths can be retrieved using the
immutable fields `Length0` and `Length1`.  For example, the following
holds of the array created above:
```
matrix.Length0 == m && matrix.Length1 == n
```
Higher-dimensional arrays are similar (`Length0`, `Length1`,
`Length2`, ...).  The array selection expression and array update
statement require that the indices are in bounds.  For example, the
swap statement above is well-formed only if:
```
0 <= i < matrix.Length0 && 0 <= j < matrix.Length1 &&
0 <= x < matrix.Length0 && 0 <= y < matrix.Length1
```

In contrast to one-dimensional arrays, there is no operation to
convert stretches of elements from a multi-dimensional array to a
sequence.

# Type object
````
ObjectType_ = "object"
````

There is a built-in trait `object` that is like a supertype of all
reference types.[^fn-object-trait] Every class automatically extends
object and so does every user-defined trait. The purpose of type `object`
is to enable a uniform treatment of _dynamic frames_. In particular, it
is useful to keep a ghost field (typically named `Repr` for
"representation") of type `set<object>`.

[^fn-object-trait]: The current compiler restriction that `object` cannot
    be used as a type parameter needs to be removed.

# Iterator types
````
IteratorDecl = "iterator" { Attribute } IteratorName
  ( [ GenericParameters ] 
    Formals(allowGhostKeyword: true)
    [ "yields" Formals(allowGhostKeyword: true) ]
  | "..."
  )
  IteratorSpec [ BlockStmt ] 
````

See section [#sec-iterator-specification] for a description of ``IteratorSpec``.

An _iterator_ provides a programming abstraction for writing code that
iteratively returns elements.  These CLU-style iterators are
_co-routines_ in the sense that they keep track of their own program
counter and control can be transferred into and out of the iterator
body.

An iterator is declared as follows:
```
iterator Iter<T>(\(_in-params_\)) yields (\(_yield-params_\))
  \(_specification_\)
{
  \(_body_\)
}
```
where `T` is a list of type parameters (as usual, if there are no type
parameters, "`<T>`" is omitted). This declaration gives rise to a
reference type with the same name, `Iter<T>`. In the signature,
in-parameters and yield-parameters are the iterator's analog of a
method's in-parameters and out-parameters. The difference is that the
out-parameters of a method are returned to a caller just once, whereas
the yield-parameters of an iterator are returned each time the iterator
body performs a `yield`. The body consists of statements, like in a
method body, but with the availability also of `yield` statements.

From the perspective of an iterator client, the `iterator` declaration
can be understood as generating a class `Iter<T>` with various
members, a simplified version of which is described next.

The `Iter<T>` class contains an anonymous constructor whose parameters
are the iterator's in-parameters:
```
predicate Valid()
constructor (\(_in-params_\))
  modifies this
  ensures Valid()
```
An iterator is created using `new` and this anonymous constructor.
For example, an iterator willing to return ten consecutive integers
from `start` can be declared as follows:
```
iterator Gen(start: int) yields (x: int)
{
  var i := 0;
  while i < 10 {
    x := start + i;
	yield;
	i := i + 1;
  }
}
```
An instance of this iterator is created using:
```
iter := new Gen(30);
```

The predicate `Valid()` says when the iterator is in a state where one
can attempt to compute more elements.  It is a postcondition of the
constructor and occurs in the specification of the `MoveNext` member:
```
method MoveNext() returns (more: bool)
  requires Valid()
  modifies this
  ensures more ==> Valid()
```
Note that the iterator remains valid as long as `MoveNext` returns
`true`.  Once `MoveNext` returns `false`, the `MoveNext` method can no
longer be called.  Note, the client is under no obligation to keep
calling `MoveNext` until it returns `false`, and the body of the
iterator is allowed to keep returning elements forever.

The in-parameters of the iterator are stored in immutable fields of
the iterator class.  To illustrate in terms of the example above, the
iterator class `Gen` contains the following field:
```
var start: int
```
The yield-parameters also result in members of the iterator class:
```
var x: int
```
These fields are set by the `MoveNext` method.  If `MoveNext` returns
`true`, the latest yield values are available in these fields and the
client can read them from there.

To aid in writing specifications, the iterator class also contains
ghost members that keep the history of values returned by
`MoveNext`.  The names of these ghost fields follow the names of the
yield-parameters with an "`s`" appended to the name (to suggest
plural).  Name checking rules make sure these names do not give rise
to ambiguities.  The iterator class for `Gen` above thus contains:
```
ghost var xs: seq<int>
```
These history fields are changed automatically by `MoveNext`, but are
not assignable by user code.

Finally, the iterator class contains some special fields for use in
specifications.  In particular, the iterator specification gets
recorded in the following immutable fields:
```
ghost var _reads: set<object>
ghost var _modifies: set<object>
ghost var _decreases0: T0
ghost var _decreases1: T1
// ...
```
where there is a `_decreases\(_i_\): T\(_i_\)` field for each
component of the iterator's `decreases`
clause.[^fn-iterator-field-names]
In addition, there is a field:
```
ghost var _new: set<object>;
```
to which any objects allocated on behalf of the iterator body get
added.  The iterator body is allowed to remove elements from the
`_new` set, but cannot by assignment to `_new` add any elements.

[^fn-iterator-field-names]:  It would make sense to rename the special
    fields `_reads` and `_modifies` to have the same names as the
    corresponding keywords, `reads` and `modifies`, as is done for
    function values.  Also, the various `_decreases\(_i_\)` fields can
    combined into one field named `decreases` whose type is a
    _n_-tuple. Thse changes may be incorporated into a future version
    of Dafny.
	
Note, in the precondition of the iterator, which is to hold upon
construction of the iterator, the in-parameters are indeed
in-parameters, not fields of `this`.

It's regrettably tricky to use iterators. The language really
ought to have a `foreach` statement to make this easier.
Here is an example showing definition and use of an iterator.

```
iterator Iter<T>(s: set<T>) yields (x: T)
  yield ensures x in s && x !in xs[..|xs|-1];
  ensures s == set z | z in xs;
{
  var r := s;
  while (r != {})
    invariant forall z :: z in xs ==> x !in r;  // r and xs are disjoint
    invariant s == r + set z | z in xs;
  {
    var y :| y in r;
    r, x := r - {y}, y;
    yield;
    assert y == xs[|xs|-1];  // needed as a lemma to prove loop invariant
  }
}

method UseIterToCopy<T>(s: set<T>) returns (t: set<T>)
  ensures s == t;
{
  t := {};
  var m := new Iter(s);
  while (true)
    invariant m.Valid() && fresh(m._new);
    invariant t == set z | z in m.xs;
    decreases s - t;
  {
    var more := m.MoveNext();
    if (!more) { break; }
    t := t + {m.x};
  }
}
```

<!--
# Async-task types

Another experimental feature in Dafny that is likely to undergo some
evolution is _asynchronous methods_.  When an asynchronous method is
called, it does not return values for the out-parameters, but instead
returns an instance of an _async-task type_.  An asynchronous method
declared in a class `C` with the following signature:
```
async method AM<T>(\(_in-params_\)) returns (\(_out-params_\))
```
also gives rise to an async-task type `AM<T>` (outside the enclosing
class, the name of the type needs the qualification `C.AM<T>`).  The
async-task type is a reference type and can be understood as a class
with various members, a simplified version of which is described next.

Each in-parameter `x` of type `X` of the asynchronous method gives
rise to a immutable ghost field of the async-task type:
```
ghost var x: X;
```
Each out-parameter `y` of type `Y` gives rise to a field
```
var y: Y;
```
These fields are changed automatically by the time the asynchronous
method is successfully awaited, but are not assignable by user code.

The async-task type also gets a number of special fields that are used
to keep track of dependencies, outstanding tasks, newly allocated
objects, etc.  These fields will be described in more detail as the
design of asynchronous methods evolves.

# Function types

````
Type = DomainType "->" Type  
````

Functions are first-class values in Dafny.  Function types have the form
`(T) -> U` where `T` is a comma-delimited list of types and `U` is a
type.  `T` is called the function's _domain type(s)_ and `U` is its
_range type_.  For example, the type of a function
```
function F(x: int, b: bool): real
```
is `(int, bool) -> real`.  Parameters are not allowed to be ghost.

To simplify the appearance of the basic case where a function's
domain consist of a list of exactly one type, the parentheses around
the domain type can be dropped in this case, as in `T -> U`.
This innocent simplification requires additional explanation in the
case where that one type is a tuple type, since tuple types are also
written with enclosing parentheses.
If the function takes a single argument that is a tuple, an additional
set of parentheses is needed.  For example, the function
```
function G(pair: (int, bool)): real
```
has type `((int, bool)) -> real`.  Note the necessary double
parentheses.  Similarly, a function that takes no arguments is
different from one that takes a 0-tuple as an argument.  For instance,
the functions
```
function NoArgs(): real
function Z(unit: ()): real
```
have types `() -> real` and `(()) -> real`, respectively.

The function arrow, `->`, is right associative, so `A -> B -> C` means
`A -> (B -> C)`.  The other association requires explicit parentheses:
`(A -> B) -> C`.

Note that the receiver parameter of a named function is not part of
the type.  Rather, it is used when looking up the function and can
then be thought of as being captured into the function definition.
For example, suppose function `F` above is declared in a class `C` and
that `c` references an object of type `C`; then, the following is type
correct:
```
var f: (int, bool) -> real := c.F;
```
whereas it would have been incorrect to have written something like:
```
var f': (C, int, bool) -> real := F;  // not correct
```

Outside its type signature, each function value has three properties,
described next.

Every function implicitly takes the heap as an argument.  No function
ever depends on the _entire_ heap, however.  A property of the
function is its declared upper bound on the set of heap locations it
depends on for a given input.  This lets the verifier figure out that
certain heap modifications have no effect on the value returned by a
certain function.  For a function `f: T -> U` and a value `t` of type
`T`, the dependency set is denoted `f.reads(t)` and has type
`set<object>`.

The second property of functions stems from the fact that every function
is potentially _partial_. In other words, a property of a function is its
_precondition_. For a function `f: T -> U`, the precondition of `f` for a
parameter value `t` of type `T` is denoted `f.requires(t)` and has type
`bool`.

The third property of a function is more obvious---the function's
body.  For a function `f: T -> U`, the value that the function yields
for an input `t` of type `T` is denoted `f(t)` and has type `U`.

Note that `f.reads` and `f.requires` are themselves functions.
Suppose `f` has type `T -> U` and `t` has type `T`.  Then, `f.reads`
is a function of type `T -> set<object>` whose `reads` and `requires`
properties are:
```
f.reads.reads(t) == f.reads(t)
f.reads.requires(t) == true
```
`f.requires` is a function of type `T -> bool` whose `reads` and
`requires` properties are:
```
f.requires.reads(t) == f.reads(t)
f.requires.requires(t) == true
```

Dafny also support anonymous functions by means of
_lambda expressions_. See section [#sec-lambda-expressions].

# Algebraic Datatypes

Dafny offers two kinds of algebraic datatypes, those defined
inductively and those defined co-inductively.  The salient property of
every datatype is that each value of the type uniquely identifies one
of the datatype's constructors and each constructor is injective in
its parameters.

````
DatatypeDecl = ( InductiveDatatypeDecl | CoinductiveDatatypeDecl ) 
````

## Inductive datatypes

````
InductiveDatatypeDecl_ = "datatype" { Attribute } DatatypeName [ GenericParameters ]
  "=" DatatypeMemberDecl { "|" DatatypeMemberDecl } [ ";" ] 
DatatypeMemberDecl = { Attribute } DatatypeMemberName [ FormalsOptionalIds ] 
````

The values of inductive datatypes can be seen as finite trees where
the leaves are values of basic types, numeric types, reference types,
co-inductive datatypes, or function types.  Indeed, values of
inductive datatypes can be compared using Dafny's well-founded
[<]{.monospace} ordering.

An inductive datatype is declared as follows:
```
datatype D<T> = \(_Ctors_\)
```
where `\(_Ctors_\)` is a nonempty `|`-separated list of
_(datatype) constructors_ for the datatype.  Each constructor has the
form:
```
C(\(_params_\))
```
where `\(_params_\)` is a comma-delimited list of types, optionally
preceded by a name for the parameter and a colon, and optionally
preceded by the keyword `ghost`.  If a constructor has no parameters,
the parentheses after the constructor name can be omitted.  If no
constructor takes a parameter, the type is usually called an
_enumeration_; for example:
```
datatype Friends = Agnes | Agatha | Jermaine | Jack
```

For every constructor `C`, Dafny defines a _discriminator_ `C?`, which
is a member that returns `true` if and only if the datatype value has
been constructed using `C`.  For every named parameter `p` of a
constructor `C`, Dafny defines a _destructor_ `p`, which is a member
that returns the `p` parameter from the `C` call used to construct the
datatype value; its use requires that `C?` holds.  For example, for
the standard `List` type
```
datatype List<T> = Nil | Cons(head: T, tail: List<T>)
```
the following holds:
```
Cons(5, Nil).Cons? && Cons(5, Nil).head == 5
```
Note that the expression
```
Cons(5, Nil).tail.head
```
is not well-formed, since `Cons(5, Nil).tail` does not satisfy
`Cons?`.

The names of the destructors must be unique across all the
constructors of the datatype.  A constructor can have the same name as
the enclosing datatype; this is especially useful for
single-constructor datatypes, which are often called
_record types_.  For example, a record type for black-and-white pixels
might be represented as follows:
```
datatype Pixel = Pixel(x: int, y: int, on: bool)
```

To call a constructor, it is usually necessary only to mention the
name of the constructor, but if this is ambiguous, it is always
possible to qualify the name of constructor by the name of the
datatype.  For example, `Cons(5, Nil)` above can be written
```
List.Cons(5, List.Nil)
```

As an alternative to calling a datatype constructor explicitly, a
datatype value can be constructed as a change in one parameter from a
given datatype value using the _datatype update_ expression.  For any
`d` whose type is a datatype that includes a constructor `C` that has
a parameter (destructor) named `f` of type `T`, and any expression `t`
of type `T`,
```
d[f := t]
```
constructs a value like `d` but whose `f` parameter is `t`.  The
operation requires that `d` satisfies `C?`.  For example, the
following equality holds:
```
Cons(4, Nil)[tail := Cons(3, Nil)] == Cons(4, Cons(3, Nil))
```

The datatype update expression also accepts multiple field 
names, provided these are distinct. For example, a node of some
inductive datatype for trees may be updated as follows:

```
node[left := L, right := R]
```

## Tuple types
````
TupleType_ = "(" [ Type { "," Type } ] ")" 
````

Dafny builds in record types that correspond to tuples and gives these
a convenient special syntax, namely parentheses.  For example, what
might have been declared as:
```
datatype Pair<T,U> = Pair(0: T, 1: U)
```
Dafny provides as the type `(T, U)` and the constructor `(t, u)`, as
if the datatype's name were "" and its type arguments are given in
round parentheses, and as if the constructor name were "".  Note that
the destructor names are `0` and `1`, which are legal identifier names
for members.  For example, showing the use of a tuple destructor, here
is a property that holds of 2-tuples (that is, _pairs_):
```
(5, true).1 == true
```

Dafny declares _n_-tuples where _n_ is 0 or 2 or up.  There are no
1-tuples, since parentheses around a single type or a single value have
no semantic meaning.  The 0-tuple type, `()`, is often known as the
_unit type_ and its single value, also written `()`, is known as _unit_.

## Co-inductive datatypes

````
CoinductiveDatatypeDecl_ = "codatatype" { Attribute } DatatypeName [ GenericParameters ]
  "=" DatatypeMemberDecl { "|" DatatypeMemberDecl } [ ";" ] 
````

Whereas Dafny insists that there is a way to construct every inductive
datatype value from the ground up, Dafny also supports
_co-inductive datatypes_, whose constructors are evaluated lazily and
hence allows infinite structures.  A co-inductive datatype is declared
using the keyword `codatatype`; other than that, it is declared and
used like an inductive datatype.

For example,
```
codatatype IList<T> = Nil | Cons(head: T, tail: IList<T>)
codatatype Stream<T> = More(head: T, tail: Stream<T>)
codatatype Tree<T> = Node(left: Tree<T>, value: T, right: Tree<T>)
```
declare possibly infinite lists (that is, lists that can be either
finite or infinite), infinite streams (that is, lists that are always
infinite), and infinite binary trees (that is, trees where every
branch goes on forever), respectively.

The paper [Co-induction Simply], by Leino and
Moskal[@LEINO:Dafny:Coinduction], explains Dafny's implementation and
verification of co-inductive types. We capture the key features from that
paper in this section but the reader is referred to that paper for more
complete details and to supply bibliographic references that we have
omitted.

Mathematical induction is a cornerstone of programming and program
verification. It arises in data definitions (e.g., some algebraic data
structures can be described using induction), it underlies program
semantics (e.g., it explains how to reason about finite iteration and
recursion), and it gets used in proofs (e.g., supporting lemmas about
data structures use inductive proofs). Whereas induction deals with
finite things (data, behavior, etc.), its dual, co-induction, deals with
possibly infinite things. Co-induction, too, is important in programming
and program verification, where it arises in data definitions (e.g., lazy
data structures), semantics (e.g., concurrency), and proofs (e.g.,
showing refinement in a co-inductive big-step semantics). It is thus
desirable to have good support for both induction and co-induction in a
system for constructing and reasoning about programs.

Co-datatypes and co-recursive functions make it possible to use lazily
evaluated data structures (like in Haskell or Agda). Co-predicates,
defined by greatest fix-points, let programs state properties of such
data structures (as can also be done in, for example, Coq). For the
purpose of writing co-inductive proofs in the language, we introduce
co-lemmas. Ostensibly, a co-lemma invokes the co-induction hypothesis
much like an inductive proof invokes the induction hypothesis. Underneath
the hood, our co-inductive proofs are actually approached via induction:
co-lemmas provide a syntactic veneer around this approach.

The following example gives a taste of how the co-inductive features in
Dafny come together to give straightforward definitions of infinite
matters.
```
// infinite streams
codatatype IStream<T> = ICons(head: T, tail: IStream)

// pointwise product of streams
function Mult(a: IStream<int>, b: IStream<int>): IStream<int>
{ ICons(a.head * b.head, Mult(a.tail, b.tail)) }

// lexicographic order on streams
copredicate Below(a: IStream<int>, b: IStream<int>)
{ a.head <= b.head && ((a.head == b.head) ==> Below(a.tail, b.tail)) }

// a stream is Below its Square
colemma Theorem_BelowSquare(a: IStream<int>)
ensures Below(a, Mult(a, a))
{ assert a.head <= Mult(a, a).head;
  if a.head == Mult(a, a).head { 
    Theorem_BelowSquare(a.tail);
  }
}

// an incorrect property and a bogus proof attempt
colemma NotATheorem_SquareBelow(a: IStream<int>)
  ensures Below(Mult(a, a), a); // ERROR
{
  NotATheorem_SquareBelow(a);
}
```

It defines a type `IStream` of infinite streams, with constructor `ICons` and
destructors `head` and `tail`. Function `Mult` performs pointwise
multiplication on infinite streams of integers, defined using a
co-recursive call (which is evaluated lazily). Co-predicate `Below` is
defined as a greatest fix-point, which intuitively means that the
co-predicate will take on the value true if the recursion goes on forever
without determining a different value. The co-lemma states the theorem
`Below(a, Mult(a, a))`. Its body gives the proof, where the recursive
invocation of the co-lemma corresponds to an invocation of the
co-induction hypothesis.

The proof of the theorem stated by the first co-lemma lends
itself to the following intuitive reading: To prove that `a` is below
`Mult(a, a)`, check that their heads are ordered and, if the heads are
equal, also prove that the tails are ordered. The second co-lemma states
a property that does not always hold; the verifier is not fooled by the
bogus proof attempt and instead reports the property as unproved.

We argue that these definitions in Dafny are simple enough to level the
playing field between induction (which is familiar) and co-induction
(which, despite being the dual of induction, is often perceived as eerily
mysterious). Moreover, the automation provided by our SMT-based verifier
reduces the tedium in writing co-inductive proofs. For example, it
verifies `Theorem_BelowSquare` from the program text given above— no
additional lemmas or tactics are needed. In fact, as a consequence of the
automatic-induction heuristic in Dafny, the verifier will
automatically verify Theorem_BelowSquare even given an empty body.

Just like there are restrictions on when an _inductive hypothesis_ can be
invoked, there are restriction on how a _co-inductive_ hypothesis can be
_used_. These are, of course, taken into consideration by our verifier.
For example, as illustrated by the second co-lemma above, invoking the
co-inductive hypothesis in an attempt to obtain the entire proof goal is
futile. (We explain how this works in section [#sec-colemmas]) Our initial experience
with co-induction in Dafny shows it to provide an intuitive, low-overhead
user experience that compares favorably to even the best of today’s
interactive proof assistants for co-induction. In addition, the
co-inductive features and verification support in Dafny have other
potential benefits. The features are a stepping stone for verifying
functional lazy programs with Dafny. Co-inductive features have also
shown to be useful in defining language semantics, as needed to verify
the correctness of a compiler, so this opens the possibility that
such verifications can benefit from SMT automation.

### Well-Founded Function/Method Definitions
The Dafny programming language supports functions and methods. A _function_
in Dafny is a mathematical function (i.e., it is well-defined,
deterministic, and pure), whereas a _method_ is a body of statements that
can mutate the state of the program. A function is defined by its given
body, which is an expression. To ensure that function definitions
are mathematically consistent, Dafny insists that recursive calls be well-founded,
enforced as follows: Dafny computes the call graph of functions. The strongly connected
components within it are _clusters_ of mutually recursive definitions arranged in
a DAG. This stratifies the functions so that a call from one cluster in the DAG to a
lower cluster is allowed arbitrarily. For an intra-cluster call, Dafny prescribes a proof
obligation that gets taken through the program verifier’s reasoning engine. Semantically,
each function activation is labeled by a _rank_—a lexicographic tuple determined
by evaluating the function’s **decreases** clause upon invocation of the function. The
proof obligation for an intra-cluster call is thus that the rank of the callee is strictly less
(in a language-defined well-founded relation) than the rank of the caller. Because
these well-founded checks correspond to proving termination of executable code, we
will often refer to them as “termination checks”. The same process applies to methods.

Lemmas in Dafny are commonly introduced by declaring a method, stating
the property of the lemma in the _postcondition_ (keyword **ensures**) of
the method, perhaps restricting the domain of the lemma by also giving a
_precondition_ (keyword **requires**), and using the lemma by invoking
the method. Lemmas are stated, used, and proved as methods, but
since they have no use at run time, such lemma methods are typically
declared as _ghost_, meaning that they are not compiled into code. The
keyword **lemma** introduces such a method. Control flow statements
correspond to proof techniques—case splits are introduced with if
statements, recursion and loops are used for induction, and method calls
for structuring the proof. Additionally, the statement:
```
forall x | P(x) { Lemma(x); }
```
is used to invoke `Lemma(x)` on all `x` for which `P(x)` holds. If
`Lemma(x)` ensures `Q(x)`, then the forall statement establishes 
```
forall x :: P(x) ==> Q(x).
```

### Defining Co-inductive Datatypes
Each value of an inductive datatype is finite, in the sense that it can
be constructed by a finite number of calls to datatype constructors. In
contrast, values of a co-inductive datatype, or co-datatype for short,
can be infinite. For example, a co-datatype can be used to represent
infinite trees.

Syntactically, the declaration of a co-datatype in Dafny looks like that
of a datatype, giving prominence to the constructors (following Coq). The
following example defines a co-datatype Stream of possibly
infinite lists.

```
codatatype Stream<T> = SNil | SCons(head: T, tail: Stream)
function Up(n: int): Stream<int> { SCons(n, Up(n+1)) }
function FivesUp(n: int): Stream<int>
  decreases 4 - (n - 1) % 5
{ 
  if (n % 5 == 0) then
    SCons(n, FivesUp(n+1))
  else
    FivesUp(n+1)
}
```

`Stream` is a co-inductive datatype whose values are possibly infinite
lists. Function `Up` returns a stream consisting of all integers upwards
of `n` and `FivesUp` returns a stream consisting of all multiples of 5
upwards of `n` . The self-call in `Up` and the first self-call in `FivesUp`
sit in productive positions and are therefore classified as co-recursive
calls, exempt from termination checks. The second self-call in `FivesUp` is
not in a productive position and is therefore subject to termination
checking; in particular, each recursive call must decrease the rank
defined by the **decreases** clause.

Analogous to the common finite list datatype, Stream declares two
constructors, `SNil` and `SCons`. Values can be destructed using match
expressions and statements. In addition, like for inductive datatypes,
each constructor `C` automatically gives rise to a discriminator `C?` and
each parameter of a constructor can be named in order to introduce a
corresponding destructor. For example, if `xs` is the stream
`SCons(x, ys)`, then `xs.SCons?` and `xs.head == x` hold. In contrast
to datatype declarations, there is no grounding check for
co-datatypes—since a codatatype admits infinite values, the type is
nevertheless inhabited.

### Creating Values of Co-datatypes
To define values of co-datatypes, one could imagine a “co-function”
language feature: the body of a “co-function” could include possibly
never-ending self-calls that are interpreted by a greatest fix-point
semantics (akin to a **CoFixpoint** in Coq). Dafny uses a different design:
it offers only functions (not “co-functions”), but it classifies each
intra-cluster call as either _recursive_ or _co-recursive_. Recursive calls
are subject to termination checks. Co-recursive calls may be
never-ending, which is what is needed to define infinite values of a
co-datatype. For example, function `Up(n )` in the preceding example is defined as the
stream of numbers from `n` upward: it returns a stream that starts with `n`
and continues as the co-recursive call `Up(n + 1)`.

To ensure that co-recursive calls give rise to mathematically consistent definitions,
they must occur only in productive positions. This says that it must be possible to determine
each successive piece of a co-datatype value after a finite amount of work. This
condition is satisfied if every co-recursive call is syntactically guarded by a constructor
of a co-datatype, which is the criterion Dafny uses to classify intra-cluster calls as being
either co-recursive or recursive. Calls that are classified as co-recursive are exempt from
termination checks.

A consequence of the productivity checks and termination checks is that, even in the
absence of talking about least or greatest fix-points of self-calling functions, all functions
in Dafny are deterministic. Since there is no issue of several possible fix-points,
the language allows one function to be involved in both recursive and co-recursive calls,
as we illustrate by the function `FivesUp`.

### Copredicates
Determining properties of co-datatype values may require an infinite
number of observations. To that avail, Dafny provides _co-predicates_
which are function declarations that use the `copredicate` keyword.
Self-calls to a co-predicate need not terminate. Instead, the value
defined is the greatest fix-point of the given recurrence equations.
Continuing the preceding example, the following code defines a
co-predicate that holds for exactly those streams whose payload consists
solely of positive integers. The co-predicate definition implicitly also
gives rise to a corresponding prefix predicate, `Pos#`. The syntax for
calling a prefix predicate sets apart the argument that specifies the
prefix length, as shown in the last line; for this figure, we took the
liberty of making up a coordinating syntax for the signature of the
automatically generated prefix predicate (which is not part of 
Dafny syntax).

```
copredicate Pos(s: Stream<int>)
{
  match s
  case SNil => true
  case SCons(x, rest) => x > 0 && Pos(rest)
}
// Automatically generated by the Dafny compiler:
predicate Pos#[_k: nat](s: Stream<int>)
  decreases _k
{ if _k = 0 then true else
  match s
  case SNil => true
  case SCons(x, rest) => x > 0 && Pos#[_k-1](rest) 
}
```

Some restrictions apply. To guarantee that the greatest fix-point always
exists, the (implicit functor defining the) co-predicate must be
monotonic. This is enforced by a syntactic restriction on the form of the
body of co-predicates: after conversion to negation normal form (i.e.,
pushing negations down to the atoms), intra-cluster calls of
co-predicates must appear only in _positive_ positions—that is, they must
appear as atoms and must not be negated. Additionally, to guarantee
soundness later on, we require that they appear in _co-friendly_
positions—that is, in negation normal form, when they appear under
existential quantification, the quantification needs to be limited to a
finite range[^fn-copredicate-restriction]. Since the evaluation of a co-predicate might not
terminate, co-predicates are always ghost. There is also a restriction on
the call graph that a cluster containing a co-predicate must contain only
co-predicates, no other kinds of functions.

[^fn-copredicate-restriction]: Higher-order function support in Dafny is
    rather modest and typical reasoning patterns do not involve them, so this
    restriction is not as limiting as it would have been in, e.g., Coq.

A **copredicate** declaration of `P` defines not just a co-predicate, but
also a corresponding _prefix predicate_ `P#`. A prefix predicate is a
finite unrolling of a co-predicate. The prefix predicate is constructed
from the co-predicate by

* adding a parameter _k of type nat to denote the prefix length,

* adding the clause "**decreases** `_k;`" to the prefix predicate (the
  co-predicate itself is not allowed to have a decreases clause),

* replacing in the body of the co-predicate every intra-cluster 
  call `Q(args)` to a copredicate by a call `Q#[_k - 1](args)`
  to the corresponding prefix predicate, and then

* prepending the body with `if _k = 0 then true else`.

For example, for co-predicate `Pos`, the definition of the prefix
predicate `Pos#` is as suggested above. Syntactically, the prefix-length
argument passed to a prefix predicate to indicate how many times to
unroll the definition is written in square brackets, as in `Pos#[k](s)`.
In the Dafny grammar this is called a ``HashCall``. The definition of
`Pos#` is available only at clusters strictly higher than that of `Pos`;
that is, `Pos` and `Pos#` must not be in the same cluster. In other
words, the definition of `Pos` cannot depend on `Pos#`.

#### Co-Equality
Equality between two values of a co-datatype is a built-in co-predicate.
It has the usual equality syntax `s == t`, and the corresponding prefix
equality is written `s ==#[k] t`. And similarly for `s != t` 
and `s !=#[k] t`.

### Co-inductive Proofs
From what we have said so far, a program can make use of properties of
co-datatypes. For example, a method that declares `Pos(s)` as a
precondition can rely on the stream `s` containing only positive integers.
In this section, we consider how such properties are established in the
first place.

#### Properties About Prefix Predicates
Among other possible strategies for establishing co-inductive properties
we take the time-honored approach of reducing co-induction to
induction. More precisely, Dafny passes to the SMT solver an
assumption `D(P)` for every co-predicate `P`, where:

```
D(P) = ? x • P(x) <==> ? k • P#[k](x)
```

In other words, a co-predicate is true iff its corresponding prefix
predicate is true for all finite unrollings.

In Sec. 4 of the paper [Co-induction Simply] a soundness theorem of such
assumptions is given, provided the co-predicates meet the co-friendly
restrictions. An example proof of `Pos(Up(n))` for every `n > 0` is 
here shown:

```
lemma UpPosLemma(n: int)
  requires n > 0
  ensures Pos(Up(n))
{
  forall k | 0 <= k { UpPosLemmaK(k, n); } 
}

lemma UpPosLemmaK(k: nat, n: int)
  requires n > 0
  ensures Pos#[k](Up(n))
  decreases k
{ 
  if k != 0 {
    // this establishes Pos#[k-1](Up(n).tail)
    UpPosLemmaK(k-1, n+1);
  }
}
```

The lemma `UpPosLemma` proves `Pos(Up(n))` for every `n > 0`. We first
show `Pos#[k](Up(n ))`, for `n > 0` and an arbitrary `k`, and then use
the forall statement to show `? k • Pos#[k](Up(n))`. Finally, the axiom
`D(Pos)` is used (automatically) to establish the co-predicate.


#### Colemmas
As we just showed, with help of the `D` axiom we can now prove a
co-predicate by inductively proving that the corresponding prefix
predicate holds for all prefix lengths `k` . In this section, we introduce
_co-lemma_ declarations, which bring about two benefits. The first benefit
is that co-lemmas are syntactic sugar and reduce the tedium of having to
write explicit quantifications over `k` . The second benefit is that, in
simple cases, the bodies of co-lemmas can be understood as co-inductive
proofs directly. As an example consider the following co-lemma.

```
colemma UpPosLemma(n: int)
  requires n > 0
  ensures Pos(Up(n))
{ 
  UpPosLemma(n+1);
}
```
This co-lemma can be understood as follows: `UpPosLemma` invokes itself
co-recursively to obtain the proof for `Pos(Up(n).tail)` (since `Up(n).tail`
equals `Up(n+1)`). The proof glue needed to then conclude `Pos(Up(n))` is
provided automatically, thanks to the power of the SMT-based verifier.

#### Prefix Lemmas
To understand why the above `UpPosLemma` co-lemma code is a sound proof,
let us now describe the details of the desugaring of co-lemmas. In
analogy to how a **copredicate** declaration defines both a co-predicate and
a prefix predicate, a **colemma** declaration defines both a co-lemma and
_prefix lemma_. In the call graph, the cluster containing a co-lemma must
contain only co-lemmas and prefix lemmas, no other methods or function.
By decree, a co-lemma and its corresponding prefix lemma are always
placed in the same cluster. Both co-lemmas and prefix lemmas are always
ghosts.

The prefix lemma is constructed from the co-lemma by

* adding a parameter `_k` of type `nat` to denote the prefix length,

* replacing in the co-lemma’s postcondition the positive co-friendly
  occurrences of co-predicates by corresponding prefix predicates,
  passing in `_k` as the prefix-length argument,

* prepending `_k` to the (typically implicit) **decreases** clause of the co-lemma,

* replacing in the body of the co-lemma every intra-cluster call
  `M(args)` to a colemma by a call `M#[_k - 1](args)` to the
  corresponding prefix lemma, and then

* making the body’s execution conditional on `_k != 0`.

Note that this rewriting removes all co-recursive calls of co-lemmas,
replacing them with recursive calls to prefix lemmas. These recursive
call are, as usual, checked to be terminating. We allow the pre-declared
identifier `_k` to appear in the original body of the
co-lemma.[^fn-co-predicate-co-lemma-diffs]

[^fn-co-predicate-co-lemma-diffs]: Note, two places where co-predicates
    and co-lemmas are not analogous are: co-predicates must not make
    recursive calls to their prefix predicates, and co-predicates cannot
    mention _k.

We can now think of the body of the co-lemma as being replaced by a
**forall** call, for every _k_ , to the prefix lemma. By construction,
this new body will establish the colemma’s declared postcondition (on
account of the `D` axiom, and remembering that only the positive
co-friendly occurrences of co-predicates in the co-lemma’s postcondition
are rewritten), so there is no reason for the program verifier to check
it.

The actual desugaring of our co-lemma `UpPosLemma` is in fact the
previous code for the `UpPosLemma` lemma except that `UpPosLemmaK` is
named `UpPosLemma#` and modulo a minor syntactic difference in how the
`k` argument is passed.

In the recursive call of the prefix lemma, there is a proof obligation
that the prefixlength argument `_k - 1` is a natural number.
Conveniently, this follows from the fact that the body has been wrapped
in an `if _k != 0` statement. This also means that the postcondition must
hold trivially when `_k = 0`, or else a postcondition violation will be
reported. This is an appropriate design for our desugaring, because
co-lemmas are expected to be used to establish co-predicates, whose
corresponding prefix predicates hold trivially when `_k = 0`. (To prove
other predicates, use an ordinary lemma, not a co-lemma.)

It is interesting to compare the intuitive understanding of the
co-inductive proof in using a co-lemma with the inductive proof in using
the lemma. Whereas the inductive proof is performing proofs for deeper
and deeper equalities, the co-lemma can be understood as producing the
infinite proof on demand.

# Newtypes
````
NewtypeDecl = "newtype" { Attribute } NewtypeName "="  
  ( NumericTypeName [ ":" Type ] "|" Expression(allowLemma: false, allowLambda: true)
  | Type               
  ) 
````

A new numeric type can be declared with the _newtype_
declaration, for example:
```
newtype N = x: M | Q
```
where `M` is a numeric type and `Q` is a boolean expression that can
use `x` as a free variable.  If `M` is an integer-based numeric type,
then so is `N`; if `M` is real-based, then so is `N`.  If the type `M`
can be inferred from `Q`, the "`: M`" can be omitted.  If `Q` is just
`true`, then the declaration can be given simply as:
```
newtype N = M
```
Type `M` is known as the _base type_ of `N`.


A newtype is a numeric type that supports the same operations as its
base type.  The newtype is distinct from and incompatible with other
numeric types; in particular, it is not assignable to its base type
without an explicit conversion.  An important difference between the
operations on a newtype and the operations on its base type is that
the newtype operations are defined only if the result satisfies the
predicate `Q`, and likewise for the literals of the
newtype.[^fn-newtype-design-question]

[^fn-newtype-design-question]: Would it be useful to also
    automatically define `predicate N?(x: M) { Q }`?

For example, suppose `lo` and `hi` are integer-based numerics that
satisfy `0 <= lo <= hi` and consider the following code fragment:
```
var mid := (lo + hi) / 2;
```
If `lo` and `hi` have type `int`, then the code fragment is legal; in
particular, it never overflows, since `int` has no upper bound.  In
contrast, if `lo` and `hi` are variables of a newtype `int32` declared
as follows:
```
newtype int32 = x | -0x80000000 <= x < 0x80000000
```
then the code fragment is erroneous, since the result of the addition
may fail to satisfy the predicate in the definition of `int32`.  The
code fragment can be rewritten as
```
var mid := lo + (hi - lo) / 2;
```
in which case it is legal for both `int` and `int32`.

Since a newtype is incompatible with its base type and since all
results of the newtype's operations are members of the newtype, a
compiler for Dafny is free to specialize the run-time representation
of the newtype.  For example, by scrutinizing the definition of
`int32` above, a compiler may decide to store `int32` values using
signed 32-bit integers in the target hardware.

Note that the bound variable `x` in `Q` has type `M`, not `N`.
Consequently, it may not be possible to state `Q` about the `N`
value.  For example, consider the following type of 8-bit 2's
complement integers:
```
newtype int8 = x: int | -128 <= x < 128
```
and consider a variable `c` of type `int8`.  The expression
```
-128 <= c < 128
```
is not well-defined, because the comparisons require each operand to
have type `int8`, which means the literal `128` is checked to be of
type `int8`, which it is not.  A proper way to write this expression
would be to use a conversion operation, described next, on `c` to
convert it to the base type:
```
-128 <= int(c) < 128
```

If possible, Dafny will represent values of the newtype using
a native data type for the sake of efficiency. This action can
be inhibited or a specific native data type selected by 
using the `{:nativeType}` attribute, as explained in 
section [#sec-nativetype].

There is a restriction that the value `0` must be part of every
newtype.[^fn-newtype-zero]

[^fn-newtype-zero]: The restriction is due to a current limitation in
    the compiler.  This will change in the future and will also open
    up the possibility for subset types and non-null reference
    types.

## Numeric conversion operations

For every numeric type `N`, there is a conversion function with the
same name.  It is a partial identity function.  It is defined when the
given value, which can be of any numeric type, is a member of the type
converted to.  When the conversion is from a real-based numeric type
to an integer-based numeric type, the operation requires that the
real-based argument has no fractional part.  (To round a real-based
numeric value down to the nearest integer, use the `.Floor` member,
see Section [#sec-numeric-types].)

To illustrate using the example from above, if `lo` and `hi` have type
`int32`, then the code fragment can legally be written as follows:
```
var mid := (int(lo) + int(hi)) / 2;
```
where the type of `mid` is inferred to be `int`.  Since the result
value of the division is a member of type `int32`, one can introduce
yet another conversion operation to make the type of `mid` be `int32`:
```
var mid := int32((int(lo) + int(hi)) / 2);
```
If the compiler does specialize the run-time representation for
`int32`, then these statements come at the expense of two,
respectively three, run-time conversions.

# Subset types
````
NatType_ = "nat" 
````

A _subset type_ is a restricted use of an existing type, called
the _base type_ of the subset type.  A subset type is like a
combined use of the base type and a predicate on the base
type.

An assignment from a subset type to its base type is always
allowed.  An assignment in the other direction, from the base type to
a subset type, is allowed provided the value assigned does indeed
satisfy the predicate of the subset type.
(Note, in contrast, assignments between a newtype and its base type
are never allowed, even if the value assigned is a value of the target
type.  For such assignments, an explicit conversion must be used, see
Section [#sec-numeric-conversion-operations].)

Dafny supports one subset type, namely the built-in type `nat`,
whose base type is `int`.[^fn-more-subset-types]  Type `nat`
designates the non-negative subrange of `int`.  A simple example that
puts subset type `nat` to good use is the standard Fibonacci
function:
```
function Fib(n: nat): nat
{
  if n < 2 then n else Fib(n-2) + Fib(n-1)
}
```
An equivalent, but clumsy, formulation of this function (modulo the
wording of any error messages produced at call sites) would be to use
type `int` and to write the restricting predicate in pre- and
postconditions:
```
function Fib(n: int): int
  requires 0 <= n  // the function argument must be non-negative
  ensures 0 <= Fib(n)  // the function result is non-negative
{
  if n < 2 then n else Fib(n-2) + Fib(n-1)
}
```

[^fn-more-subset-types]:  A future version of Dafny will support
    user-defined subset types.

Type inference will never infer the type of a variable to be a
subset type.  It will instead infer the type to be the base type
of the subset type.  For example, the type of `x` in
```
forall x :: P(x)
```
will be `int`, even if predicate `P` declares its argument to have
type `nat`.

Many of Dafny's statements are similar to those in traditional
programming languages, but a number of them are significantly different.
This grammar production shows the different kinds of Dafny statements.
They are described in subsequent sections.

## Labeled Statement 
````
LabeledStmt_ = "label" LabelName ":" Stmt 
````
A labeled statement is just the keyword `label` followed by an identifier
which is the label followed by a colon and a statement. The label may be
referenced in a break statement to transfer control to the location after
that statement. The label is not allowed to be the same as any enclosing
label. 

## Break Statement
````
BreakStmt_ = "break" ( LabelName | { "break" } ) ";" 
````
A break statement breaks out of one or more loops (if the
statement consists solely of one or more `break` keywords),
or else transfers control to just past the statement
bearing the referenced label, if a label was used.

If a label is used, the break statement must be enclosed in a statement
with that label. If no label is specified and the statement list `n` 
occurrences of `break`, then the statement must be enclosed in 
(at least) `n` levels of loops. For example,

```
break break;
```

## Block Statement
````
BlockStmt = "{" { Stmt } "}" 
````
A block statement is just a sequence of statements enclosed by curly braces.
Local variables declared in the block end their scope at the end of the block.

## Return Statement
````
ReturnStmt = "return" [ Rhs { "," Rhs } ] ";" 
````
A return statement can only be used in a method. It is used
to terminate the execution of the method.

To return a value from a method, the value is assigned to one 
of the named out-parameters sometime before a return statement.
In fact, the out-parameters act very much like local variables, 
and can be assigned to more than once. Return statements are 
used when one wants to return before reaching the end of the 
body block of the method. 

Return statements can be just the return keyword (where the current value
of the out-parameters are used), or they can take a list of expressions to
return. If a list is given, the number of expressions given must be the same
as the number of named out-parameters. These expressions are
evaluated, then they are assigned to the out-parameters, and then the
method terminates.

## Yield Statement
````
YieldStmt = "yield" [ Rhs { "," Rhs } ] ";" 
````

A yield statement can only be used in an iterator.
See section [Iterator types](#sec-iterator-types) for more details
about iterators.

The body of an iterator is a _co-routine_. It is used
to yield control to its caller, signaling that a new
set of values for the iterator's yield parameters (if any)
are available. Values are assigned to the yield parameters 
at or before a yield statement.
In fact, the yield parameters act very much like local variables, 
and can be assigned to more than once. Yield statements are 
used when one wants to return new yield parameter values
to the caller. Yield statements can be just the 
**yield** keyword (where the current value of the yield parameters 
are used), or they can take a list of expressions to yield.
If a list is given, the number of expressions given must be the
same as the number of named return yield parameters.
These expressions are then evaluated, then they are
assigned to the yield parameters, and then the iterator
yields.

## Update and Call Statements
````
UpdateStmt =
    Lhs
    ( {Attribute} ";"
    |
     { "," Lhs }
     ( ":=" Rhs { "," Rhs }
     | ":|" [ "assume" ] Expression(allowLemma: false, allowLambda: true)
     )
     ";"
    | ":"
    ) 
````

````
CallStmt_ = 
    [ Lhs { , Lhs } ":=" ] Lhs ";"
````

The update statement server three logical purposes. 

First, if it matches the grammar of a ``CallStmt_`` in which the right-most ``Lhs``
references a method and arguments to pass to it, then the ``UpdateStmt`` is a
method call or a new allocation with an initializing method. 
These are the only ways in which a method call is allowed in an update statement. 
In particular, the result of one method call is not allowed to be used 
as an argument of another method call (as if it had been an expression).

The form

```
Lhs {Attribute} ";"
```
is assumed to be a call to a method with no out-parameters. 

The form

```
    [ Lhs { , Lhs } ":=" ] Lhs ";"
```
can occur in the ``UpdateStmt`` grammar when there is a single Rhs that
takes the special form of a ``Lhs`` that is a call. That is the only case
where the number of left-hand sides can be different than the number of
right-hand sides in the ``UpdateStmt``. In that case the number of 
left-hand sides must match the number of out-parameters of the 
method that is called. 

Second, if no call is involved, the ``UpdateStmt`` can be a parallel
assignment of right-hand-side values to the left-hand sides. For example
`x,y := y,x` to swap the values of `x` and `y`. If more than one
left-hand side is used, these must denote different l-values, unless the
corresponding right-hand sides also denote the same value. There must
be an equal number of left-hand sides and righ-hand sides in this case.
Of course, the most common case will have only one
``Rhs`` and one ``Lhs``.

Thirdly, the form that uses "`:|`" assigns some values to the left-hand side
variables such that the boolean expression on the right hand side
is satisfied. This can be used to make a choice as in the
following example where we choose an element in a set.

```
method Sum(X: set<int>) returns (s: int)
{
  s := 0; var Y := X;
  while Y != {}
    decreases Y
  {
    var y: int;
    y :| y in Y;
    s, Y := s + y, Y - {y};
  }
}
```

Dafny will report an error if it cannot prove that values 
exist which satisfy the condition.

In addition, though the choice is arbitrary, given identical
circumstances the choice will be made consistently.

The form 

````
    Lhs ":"
````

is diagnosed as a label in which the user forgot the **label** keyword.

## Variable Declaration Statement
````
VarDeclStatement = [ "ghost" ] "var" { Attribute }
  (
    LocalIdentTypeOptional { "," { Attribute } LocalIdentTypeOptional }
    [ ":=" Rhs { "," Rhs }
    | { Attribute } ":|" [ "assume" ] Expression(allowLemma: false, allowLambda: true)
    ]
  |
    "(" CasePattern { "," CasePattern } ")"
    ":=" Expression(allowLemma: false, allowLambda: true)
  )
  ";"
````

A ``VarDeclStatement`` is used to declare one or more local variables in
a method or function. The type of each local variable must be given
unless its type can be inferred, either from a given initial value, or
from other uses of the variable. If initial values are given, the number
of values must match the number of variables declared.

Note that the type of each variable must be given individually. The following code

```
var x, y : int;
```
does not declare both `x` and `y` to be of type `int`. Rather it will give an
error explaining that the type of `x` is underspecified if it cannot be 
inferred from uses of x. 

What follows the ``LocalIdentTypeOptional`` optionally combines the variables
declarations with an update statement, see [#sec-update-and-call-statements].
If the Rhs is a call, then any variable receiving the value of a 
formal ghost out-parameter will automatically be declared as ghost, even
if the **ghost** keyword is not part of the variable declaration statement.

The left-hand side can also contain a tuple of patterns which will be 
matched against the right-hand-side. For example:

```
function returnsTuple() : (int, int)
{
    (5, 10)
}

function usesTuple() : int
{
    var (x, y) := returnsTuple();
    x + y
}
```

## Guards
````
Guard = ( "*" | "(" "*" ")" | Expression(allowLemma: true, allowLambda: true) ) 
````
Guards are used in `if` and `while` statements as boolean expressions. Guards 
take two forms.

The first and most common form is just a boolean expression.

The second form is either `*` or `(*)`. These have the same meaning. An
unspecified boolean value is returned. The value returned
may be different each time it is executed.

## Binding Guards
````
BindingGuard(allowLambda) =
  IdentTypeOptional { "," IdentTypeOptional } { Attribute }
  ":|" Expression(allowLemma: true, allowLambda)
````

``IfStmt``s can also take a ``BindingGuard``.
It checks if there exist values for the given variables that satisfy the given expression.
If so, it binds some satisfying values to the variables and proceeds
into the "then" branch; otherwise it proceeds with the "else" branch,
where the bound variables are not in scope.

In other words, the statement

```
if x :| P { S } else { T }
```

has the same meaning as 

```
if exists x :| P { var x :| P; S } else { T }
```

The identifiers bound by ``BindingGuard`` are ghost variables
and cannot be assigned to non-ghost variables. They are only
used in specification contexts. 

Here is an example:

```
predicate P(n: int)
{
  n % 2 == 0
}

method M1() returns (ghost y: int)
    requires exists x :: P(x)
    ensures P(y)
{
  if x : int :| P(x) {
      y := x;
  }
}
```

## If Statement
````
IfStmt = "if"
  ( IfAlternativeBlock
  |
    ( BindingGuard(allowLambda: true)
    | Guard
    | "..."
    )
    BlockStmt [ "else" ( IfStmt | BlockStmt ) ]
  )
````

````
IfAlternativeBlock =
   "{" { "case" 
      (
        BindingGuard(allowLambda:false)
      | Expression(allowLemma: true, allowLambda: false)
      ) "=>" { Stmt } } "}" .
````

The simplest form an `if` statement uses a guard that is a boolean 
expression. It then has the same form as in C# and other common
programming languages. For example

```
  if x < 0 {
    x := -x;
  }
```

If the guard is an asterisk then a non-deterministic choice is made:

```
  if * {
    print "True";
  } else {
    print "False";
  }
```

The `if` statement using the `IfAlternativeBlock` form is similar to the 
`if ... fi` construct used in the book "A Discipline of Programming" by
Edsger W. Dijkstra. It is used for a multi-branch `if`.

For example:
```
  if {
    case x <= y => max := y;
    case y <= x => max := y;
  }
```

In this form, the expressions following the `case` keyword are called
_guards_. The statement is evaluated by evaluating the guards in an
undetermined order until one is found that is `true` and the statements
to the right of `=>` for that guard are executed. The statement requires
at least one of the guards to evaluate to `true`.

## While Statement
````
WhileStmt = "while"
  ( LoopSpecWhile WhileAlternativeBlock
  | ( Guard | "..." ) LoopSpec
      ( BlockStmt
      | "..."
      | /* go body-less */
      )
  ) 
````

````
WhileAlternativeBlock =
   "{" { "case" Expression(allowLemma: true, allowLambda: false) "=>" { Stmt } } "}" .
````

See section [#sec-loop-specification] for a description of ``LoopSpec``.

The `while` statement is Dafny's only loop statement. It has two general
forms.

The first form is similar to a while loop in a C-like language. For
example:

```
  var i := 0;
  while i < 5 {
    i := i + 1;
  }
```

In this form, the condition following the `while` is one of these:

* A boolean expression. If true it means execute one more
iteration of the loop. If false then terminate the loop.
* An asterisk (`*`), meaning non-deterministically yield either
`true` or `false` as the value of the condition

<!--
Keep the following commented out until we decide a better
place to put it.

* An ellipsis (`...`), which makes the while statement a _skeleton_ 
`while` statement. TODO: What does that mean?

The _body_ of the loop is usually a block statement, but it can also
be a _skeleton_, denoted by ellipsis, or missing altogether.
TODO: Wouldn't a missing body cause problems? Isn't it clearer to have
a block statement with no statements inside?
-->

The second form uses the `WhileAlternativeBlock`. It is similar to the 
`do ... od` construct used in the book "A Discipline of Programming" by
Edsger W. Dijkstra. For example:

```
  while
    decreases if 0 <= r then r else -r;
  {
    case r < 0 =>
      r := r + 1;
    case 0 < r =>
      r := r - 1;
  }
```
For this form, the guards are evaluated in some undetermined order
until one is found that is true, in which case the corresponding statements
are executed. If none of the guards evaluates to true, then the
loop execution is terminated.

### Loop Specifications
For some simple loops, such as those mentioned previously, Dafny can figure
out what the loop is doing without more help. However, in general the user
must provide more information in order to help Dafny prove the effect of
the loop. This information is provided by a ``LoopSpec``. A
``LoopSpec`` provides information about invariants, termination, and
what the loop modifies. ``LoopSpecs`` are explained in 
section [#sec-loop-specification]. However the following sections
present additional rationale and tutorial on loop specifications.
For additional tutorial information see [@KoenigLeino:MOD2011] or the 
[online Dafny tutorial](http://rise4fun.com/Dafny/tutorial/Guide).

#### Loop Invariants

`While` loops present a problem for Dafny. There is no way for Dafny to
know in advance how many times the code will go around the loop. But
Dafny needs to consider all paths through a program, which could include
going around the loop any number of times. To make it possible for Dafny
to work with loops, you need to provide loop invariants, another kind of
annotation.

A loop invariant is an expression that holds upon entering a loop, and
after every execution of the loop body. It captures something that is
invariant, i.e. does not change, about every step of the loop. Now,
obviously we are going to want to change variables, etc. each time around
the loop, or we wouldn't need the loop. Like pre- and postconditions, an
invariant is a property that is preserved for each execution of the loop,
expressed using the same boolean expressions we have seen. For example,

```
var i := 0;
while i < n
  invariant 0 <= i
{
  i := i + 1;
}
```

When you specify an invariant, Dafny proves two things: the invariant
holds upon entering the loop, and it is preserved by the loop. By
preserved, we mean that assuming that the invariant holds at the
beginning of the loop, we must show that executing the loop body once
makes the invariant hold again. Dafny can only know upon analyzing the
loop body what the invariants say, in addition to the loop guard (the
loop condition). Just as Dafny will not discover properties of a method
on its own, it will not know any but the most basic properties of a loop
are preserved unless it is told via an invariant.

#### Loop Termination

Dafny proves that code terminates, i.e. does not loop forever, by using
`decreases` annotations. For many things, Dafny is able to guess the right
annotations, but sometimes it needs to be made explicit. 
There are two places Dafny proves termination: loops and recursion.
Both of these situations require either an explicit annotation or a
correct guess by Dafny.

A `decreases` annotation, as its name suggests, gives Dafny an expression
that decreases with every loop iteration or recursive call. There are two
conditions that Dafny needs to verify when using a decreases expression:

* that the expression actually gets smaller, and 
* that it is bounded.

Many times, an integral value (natural or plain integer) is the quantity
that decreases, but other things that can be used as well. In the case of
integers, the bound is assumed to be zero. For example, the following is
a proper use of decreases on a loop (with its own keyword, of course):

```
  while 0 < i
    invariant 0 <= i
	decreases i
  {
    i := i - 1;
  }
```

Here Dafny has all the ingredients it needs to prove termination. The
variable i gets smaller each loop iteration, and is bounded below by
zero. This is fine, except the loop is backwards from most loops, which
tend to count up instead of down. In this case, what decreases is not the
counter itself, but rather the distance between the counter and the upper
bound. A simple trick for dealing with this situation is given below:

```
  while i < n
    invariant 0 <= i <= n
    decreases n - i
  {
    i := i + 1;
  }
```

This is actually Dafny's guess for this situation, as it sees `i < n` and
assumes that `n - i` is the quantity that decreases. The upper bound of the
loop invariant implies that `0 <= n – i`, and gives Dafny a lower bound on
the quantity. This also works when the bound `n` is not constant, such as
in the binary search algorithm, where two quantities approach each other,
and neither is fixed.

If the **decreases** clause of a loop specified "*", then no
termination check will be performed. Use of this feature is sound only with
respect to partial correctness.

#### Loop Framing
In some cases we also must specify what memory locations the loop body
is allowed to modify. This is done using a `modifies` clause.
See the discussion of framing in methods for a fuller discussion.

## Match Statement
````
MatchStmt = "match" Expression(allowLemma: true, allowLambda: true)
  ( "{" { CaseStatement  } "}"
  | { CaseStatement }
  ) 

CaseStatement = CaseBinding_ "=>" { Stmt } 
````

The `match` statement is used to do case analysis on a value of inductive
or co-inductive type. The form with no leading ``Ident`` is for matching
tuples. The expression after the `match` keyword is the (co)inductive
value being matched. The expression is evaluated and then matched against
each of the case clauses.

There must be a case clause for each constructor of the data type.
The identifier after the `case` keyword in a case clause, if present,
must be the name of one of the data type's constructors.
If the constructor takes parameters then a parenthesis-enclosed
list of identifiers (with optional type) must follow the
constructor. There must be as many identifiers as the constructor
has parameters. If the optional type is given it must be the same
as the type of the corresponding parameter of the constructor.
If no type is given then the type of the corresponding parameter
is the type assigned to the identifier. If an identifier is not used
in a case, it can be replaced by an underscore.

When an inductive value that was created using constructor
expression `C1(v1, v2)` is matched against a case clause
`C2(x1, x2`), there is a match provided that `C1` and `C2` are the
same constructor. In that case `x1` is bound to value `v1` and
`x2` is bound to `v2`. The identifiers in the case pattern
are not mutable. Here is an example of the use of a `match` statement.

```
datatype Tree = Empty | Node(left: Tree, data: int, right: Tree)

// Return the sum of the data in a tree.
method Sum(x: Tree) returns (r: int)
{
  match x {
    case Empty => r := 0;
	case Node(t1, d, t2) =>
	  var v1 := Sum(t1);
	  var v2 := Sum(t2);
	  r := v1 + d + v2;
 }
}
```

Note that the `Sum` method is recursive yet has no `decreases` annotation.
In this case it is not needed because Dafny is able to deduce that
`t1` and `t2` are _smaller_ (structurally) than `x`. If `Tree` had been
coinductive this would not have been possible since `x` might have been
infinite.

## Assert Statement
````
AssertStmt = 
    "assert" { Attribute } 
    ( Expression(allowLemma: false, allowLambda: true) 
    | "..." 
    ) ";" 
````

`Assert` statements are used to express logical proposition that are
expected to be true. Dafny will attempt to prove that the assertion
is true and give an error if not. Once it has proved the assertion,
it can then use its truth to aid in following deductions.
Thus if Dafny is having a difficult time verifying a method,
the user may help by inserting assertions that Dafny can prove,
and whose truth may aid in the larger verification effort.

<!--
Describe where refinement is described.

If the proposition is `...` then (TODO: what does this mean?).
-->

## Assume Statement
````
AssumeStmt = 
    "assume" { Attribute } 
    ( Expression(allowLemma: false, allowLambda: true) 
    | "..." 
    ) ";" 
````

The `Assume` statement lets the user specify a logical proposition
that Dafny may assume to be true without proof. If in fact the
proposition is not true this may lead to invalid conclusions.

An `Assume` statement would ordinarily be used as part of a larger
verification effort where verification of some other part of
the program required the proposition. By using the `Assume` statement
the other verification can proceed. Then when that is completed the
user would come back and replace the `assume` with `assert`.

An `Assume` statement cannot be compiled. In fact, the compiler
will complain if it finds an **assume** anywhere where it has not 
been replaced through a refinement steop.

<!--
Describe where refinement is described.

If the proposition is `...` then (TODO: what does this mean?).
-->

## Print Statement
````
PrintStmt = 
    "print" Expression(allowLemma: false, allowLambda: true) 
    { "," Expression(allowLemma: false, allowLambda: true) } ";" 
````

The `print` statement is used to print the values of a comma-separated
list of expressions to the console. The generated C# code uses
the `System.Object.ToString()` method to convert the values to printable
strings. The expressions may of course include strings that are used
for captions. There is no implicit new line added, so to get a new
line you should include "\n" as part of one of the expressions.
Dafny automatically creates overrides for the ToString() method
for Dafny data types. For example,

```
datatype Tree = Empty | Node(left: Tree, data: int, right: Tree)
method Main()
{
  var x : Tree := Node(Node(Empty, 1, Empty), 2, Empty);
  print "x=", x, "\n";
}
```

produces this output:

```
x=Tree.Node(Tree.Node(Tree.Empty, 1, Tree.Empty), 2, Tree.Empty)
```

## Forall Statement
````
ForallStmt = "forall"
  ( "(" [ QuantifierDomain ] ")"
  | [ QuantifierDomain ]
  )
  { ForAllEnsuresClause_ }
  [ BlockStmt ]
````

The `forall` statement executes the body in 
parallel for all quantified values in the specified range.
There are several variant uses of the `forall`
statement. And there are a number of restrictions.

In particular, a `forall` statement can be classified as one of the following:

* _Assign_ - the `forall` statement is used for simultaneous assignment.
The target must be an array element or an object field.
* _Call_ - The body consists of a single call to a ghost method without side effects
* _Proof_ - The `forall` has `ensure` expressions which are effectively
quantified or proved by the body (if present).

An _assign_ `forall` statement is to perform simultaneous assignment.
The left-hand sides must denote different l-values, unless the 
corresponding right-hand sides also coincide.

The following is an excerpt of an example given by Leino in
[Developing Verified Programs with Dafny][leino233].
When the buffer holding the queue needs to be resized,
the `forall` statement is used to simultaneously copy the old contents
into the new buffer.

[leino233]: http://research.microsoft.com/en-us/um/people/leino/papers/krml233.pdf

```
class {:autocontracts} SimpleQueue<Data>
{
  ghost var Contents: seq<Data>;
  var a: array<Data>  // Buffer holding contents of queue.
  var m: int          // Index head of queue.
  var n: int          // Index just past end of queue
  ...
  method Enqueue(d: Data)
    ensures Contents == old(Contents) + [d]
  {
    if n == a.Length {
      var b := a;
      if m == 0 { b := new Data[2 * a.Length]; }
      forall i | 0 <= i < n - m {
      	b[i] := a[m + i];
      }
      a, m, n := b, 0, n - m;
    }
    a[n], n, Contents := d, n + 1, Contents + [d];
  }
}
```

Here is an example of a _call_ `forall` statement and the
callee. This is contained in the CloudMake-ConsistentBuilds.dfy
test in the Dafny repository.

```
forall cmd', deps', e' | Hash(Loc(cmd', deps', e')) == Hash(Loc(cmd, deps, e)) {
  HashProperty(cmd', deps', e', cmd, deps, e);
}

lemma HashProperty(cmd: Expression, deps: Expression, ext: string, 
    cmd': Expression, deps': Expression, ext': string)
  requires Hash(Loc(cmd, deps, ext)) == Hash(Loc(cmd', deps', ext'))
  ensures cmd == cmd' && deps == deps' && ext == ext'
```

From the same file here is an example of a _proof_ `forall` statement.

```
forall p | p in DomSt(stCombinedC.st) && p in DomSt(stExecC.st)
  ensures GetSt(p, stCombinedC.st) == GetSt(p, stExecC.st)
{
  assert DomSt(stCombinedC.st) <= DomSt(stExecC.st);
  assert stCombinedC.st == Restrict(DomSt(stCombinedC.st), stExecC.st);
}
```

More generally, the statement
```
forall x | P(x) { Lemma(x); }
```
is used to invoke `Lemma(x)` on all `x` for which `P(x)` holds. If
`Lemma(x)` ensures `Q(x)`, then the forall statement establishes 
```
forall x :: P(x) ==> Q(x).
```

The `forall` statement is also used extensively in the de-sugared forms of
co-predicates and co-lemmas. See section [#sec-co-inductive-datatypes].

## Modify Statement
````
ModifyStmt = 
  "modify" { Attribute }
  ( FrameExpression(allowLemma: false, allowLambda: true)
    { "," FrameExpression(allowLemma: false, allowLambda: true) }
  | "..."
  )
  ( BlockStmt | ";" )
````

The `modify` statement has two forms which have two different
purposes.

When the `modify` statement ends with a semi-colon rather than
a block statement its effect is to say that some undetermined
modifications have been made to any or all of the memory
locations specified by the [frame expressions](#sec-frame-expressions).
In the following example, a value is assigned to field `x`
followed by a `modify` statement that may modify any field
in the object. After that we can no longer prove that the field
`x` still has the value we assigned to it.

```
class MyClass {
  var x: int
  method N()
    modifies this
  {
    x := 18;
    modify this;
    assert x == 18;  // error: cannot conclude this here
  }
}
```

When the `modify` statement is followed by a block statement,
we are instead specifying what can be modified in that
block statement. Namely, only memory locations specified
by the frame expressions of the block `modify` statement
may be modified. Consider the following example.

```
class ModifyBody {
  var x: int
  var y: int
  method M0()
    modifies this
  {
    modify {} {
      x := 3;  // error: violates modifies clause of the modify statement
    }
  }
  method M1()
    modifies this
  {
    modify {} {
      var o := new ModifyBody;
      o.x := 3;  // fine
    }
  }
  method M2()
    modifies this
  {
    modify this {
      x := 3;
    }
  }
}
```

The first `modify` statement in the example has an empty
frame expression so it cannot modify any memory locations.
So an error is reported when it tries to modify field `x`.

The second `modify` statement also has an empty frame 
expression. But it allocates a new object and modifies it.
Thus we see that the frame expressions on a block `modify`
statement only limits what may be modified of existing 
memory. It does not limit what may be modified in 
new memory that is allocated.

The third `modify` statement has a frame expression that
allows it to modify any of the fields of the current object,
so the modification of field `x` is allowed.

## Calc Statement
````
CalcStmt = "calc" { Attribute } [ CalcOp ] "{" CalcBody "}" 
CalcBody = { CalcLine [ CalcOp ] Hints } 
CalcLine = Expression(allowLemma: false, allowLambda: true) ";" 
Hints = { ( BlockStmt | CalcStmt ) } 
CalcOp =
  ( "==" [ "#" "[" Expression(allowLemma: true, allowLambda: true) "]" ]
  | "<" | ">" 
  | "!=" | "<=" | ">="
  | "<==>" | "==>" | "<=="
  ) 
````

[Verified Calculations]: http://research.microsoft.com/en-us/um/people/leino/papers/krml231.pdf

The `calc` statement supports _calculational proofs_ using a language
feature called _program-oriented calculations_ (poC). This feature was
introduced and explained in the [Verified Calculations] paper by Leino
and Polikarpova[@LEINO:Dafny:Calc]. Please see that paper for a more
complete explanation of the `calc` statement. We here mention only the
highlights.

Calculational proofs are proofs by stepwise formula manipulation 
as is taught in elementary algebra. The typical example is to prove
an equality by starting with a left-hand-side, and through a series of
transformations morph it into the desired right-hand-side.

Non-syntactic rules further restrict hints to only ghost and side-effect
free statements, as well as impose a constraint that only
chain-compatible operators can be used together in a calculation. The
notion of chain-compatibility is quite intuitive for the operators
supported by poC; for example, it is clear that "<" and ">" cannot be used within
the same calculation, as there would be no relation to conclude between
the first and the last line. See the [paper][Verified Calculations] for 
a more formal treatment of chain-compatibility.

Note that we allow a single occurrence of the intransitive operator "!=" to
appear in a chain of equalities (that is, "!=" is chain-compatible with
equality but not with any other operator, including itself). Calculations
with fewer than two lines are allowed, but have no effect. If a step
operator is omitted, it defaults to the calculation-wide operator,
defined after the `calc` keyword. If that operator if omitted, it defaults
to equality.

Here is an example using `calc` statements to prove an elementary
algebraic identity. As it turns out, Dafny is able to prove this without
the `calc` statements, but it helps to illustrate the syntax.

```
lemma docalc(x : int, y: int)
  ensures (x + y) * (x + y) == x * x + 2 * x * y + y * y
{
  calc {
    (x + y) * (x + y);
    ==
    // distributive law: (a + b) * c == a * c + b * c
    x * (x + y) + y * (x + y);
    ==
    // distributive law: a * (b + c) == a * b + a * c
    x * x + x * y + y * x + y * y;
    ==
    calc {
	    y * x;
      ==
	    x * y;
    }
    x * x + x * y + x * y + y * y;
    ==
    calc {
      x * y + x * y;
      ==
      // a = 1 * a
      1 * x * y + 1 * x * y;
      ==
      // Distributive law
      (1 + 1) * x * y;
      ==
      2 * x * y;
    }
    x * x + 2 * x * y + y * y;
  }
}
```

Here we started with `(x + y) * (x + y)` as the left-hand-side
expressions and gradually transformed it using distributive,
commutative and other laws into the desired right-hand-side.

The justification for the steps are given as comments, or as
nested `calc` statements that prove equality of some sub-parts
of the expression.

The `==` operators show the relation between
the previous expression and the next. Because of the transitivity of 
equality we can then conclude that the original left-hand-side is
equal to the final expression.

We can avoid having to supply the relational operator between
every pair of expressions by giving a default operator between
the `calc` keyword and the opening brace as shown in this abbreviated
version of the above calc statement:

```
calc == {
  (x + y) * (x + y);
  x * (x + y) + y * (x + y);
  x * x + x * y + y * x + y * y;
  x * x + x * y + x * y + y * y;
  x * x + 2 * x * y + y * y;
}
```

And since equality is the default operator, we could have omitted
it after the `calc` keyword.
The purpose of the block statements or the `calc` statements between
the expressions is to provide hints to aid Dafny in proving that
step. As shown in the example, comments can also be used to aid
the human reader in cases where Dafny can prove the step automatically.

# Expressions
The grammar of Dafny expressions follows a hierarchy that 
reflects the precedence of Dafny operators. The following
table shows the Dafny operators and their precedence
in order of increasing binding power.

+--------------------------+------------------------------------+

| Primary Expressions      |                                    |
+--------------------------+------------------------------------+

We are calling the ``UnaryExpression``s that are neither
arithmetic nor logical negation the _primary expressions_.
They are the most tightly bound.

In the grammar entries below we explain the meaning when the 
operator for that precedence level is present. If the
operator is not present then we just descend to the
next precedence level.

## Top-level expressions
````
Expression(allowLemma, allowLambda) = 
    EquivExpression(allowLemma, allowLambda)
    [ ";" Expression(allowLemma, allowLambda) ] 
````

The "allowLemma" argument says whether or not the expression
to be parsed is allowed to have the form S;E where S is a call to a lemma.
"allowLemma" should be passed in as "false" whenever the expression to
be parsed sits in a context that itself is terminated by a semi-colon.

The "allowLambda" says whether or not the expression to be parsed is
allowed to be a lambda expression.  More precisely, an identifier or
parenthesized-enclosed comma-delimited list of identifiers is allowed to
continue as a lambda expression (that is, continue with a "reads", "requires",
or "=>") only if "allowLambda" is true.  This affects function/method/iterator
specifications, if/while statements with guarded alternatives, and expressions
in the specification of a lambda expression itself.

Sometimes an expression will fail unless some relevant fact is known.
In the following example the `F_Fails` function fails to verify 
because the `Fact(n)` divisor may be zero. But preceding
the expression by a lemma that ensures that the denominator
is not zero allows function `F_Succeeds` to succeed.
```
function Fact(n: nat): nat
{
  if n == 0 then 1 else n * Fact(n-1)
}

lemma L(n: nat)
  ensures 1 <= Fact(n)
{
}

function F_Fails(n: nat): int
{
  50 / Fact(n)  // error: possible division by zero
}

function F_Succeeds(n: nat): int
{
  L(n); // note, this is a lemma call in an expression
  50 / Fact(n)
}
```

## Equivalence Expressions
````
EquivExpression(allowLemma, allowLambda) = 
  ImpliesExpliesExpression(allowLemma, allowLambda)
  { "<==>" ImpliesExpliesExpression(allowLemma, allowLambda) } 
````
An ``EquivExpression`` that contains one or more "<==>"s is
a boolean expression and all the contained ``ImpliesExpliesExpression``
must also be boolean expressions. In that case each "<==>"
operator tests for logical equality which is the same as
ordinary equality.

See section [#sec-equivalence-operator] for an explanation of the
`<==>` operator as compared with the `==` operator.

## Implies or Explies Expressions
````
ImpliesExpliesExpression(allowLemma, allowLambda) =
  LogicalExpression(allowLemma, allowLambda)
  [ (  "==>" ImpliesExpression(allowLemma, allowLambda)
    | "<==" LogicalExpression(allowLemma, allowLambda)
            { "<==" LogicalExpression(allowLemma, allowLambda) }
    )
  ] 

ImpliesExpression(allowLemma, allowLambda) =
  LogicalExpression(allowLemma, allowLambda) 
  [  "==>" ImpliesExpression(allowLemma, allowLambda) ] 
````

See section [#sec-implication-and-reverse-implication] for an explanation
of the `==>` and `<==` operators.

## Logical Expressions

````
LogicalExpression(allowLemma, allowLambda) =
  RelationalExpression(allowLemma, allowLambda)
  [ ( "&&" RelationalExpression(allowLemma, allowLambda)
           { "&&" RelationalExpression(allowLemma, allowLambda) }
    | "||" RelationalExpression(allowLemma, allowLambda)
           { "||" RelationalExpression(allowLemma, allowLambda) }
    )
  ] 
````

See section [#sec-conjunction-and-disjunction] for an explanation 
of the `&&` (or &and;) and `||` (or &or;) operators.

## Relational Expressions
````
RelationalExpression(allowLemma, allowLambda) =
  Term(allowLemma, allowLambda)
  { RelOp Term(allowLemma, allowLambda) }

RelOp =
  ( "==" [ "#" "[" Expression(allowLemma: true, allowLambda: true) "]" ]
  | "<" | ">" | "<=" | ">=" 
  | "!=" [ "#" "[" Expression(allowLemma: true, allowLambda: true) "]" ]
  | "in"
  | "!in"
  | "!!"
  )
  
````

The relation expressions that have a ``RelOp`` compare two or more terms.
As explained in section [#sec-basic-types], `==`, `!=`, ``<``, `>`, `<=`, and `>=` 
and their corresponding Unicode equivalents are _chaining_.

The `in` and `!in` operators apply to collection types as explained in 
section [#sec-collection-types] and represent membership or non-membership
respectively.

The `!!` represents disjointness for sets and multisets as explained in 
sections [#sec-sets] and [#sec-multisets].

Note that `x ==#[k] y` is the prefix equality operator that compares
co-inductive values for equality to a nesting level of k, as 
explained in section [#sec-co-equality].

## Terms
````
Term(allowLemma, allowLambda) =
  Factor(allowLemma, allowLambda)
  { AddOp Factor(allowLemma, allowLambda) } 
AddOp = ( "+" | "-" ) 
````

`Terms` combine `Factors` by adding or subtracting.
Addition has these meanings for different types:

* Arithmetic addition for numeric types (section [#sec-numeric-types]).
* Union for sets and multisets (sections [#sec-sets] and [#sec-multisets])
* Concatenation for sequences (section [#sec-sequences])

Subtraction is arithmetic subtraction for numeric types, and set or multiset
difference for sets and multisets.

## Factors
````
Factor(allowLemma, allowLambda) =
  UnaryExpression(allowLemma, allowLambda)
  { MulOp UnaryExpression(allowLemma, allowLambda) } 
MulOp = ( "*" | "/" | "%" ) 
````

A ``Factor`` combines ``UnaryExpression``s using multiplication,
division, or modulus. For numeric types these are explained in
section [#sec-numeric-types].

Only `*` has a non-numeric application. It represents set or multiset
intersection as explained in sections [#sec-sets] and [#sec-multisets].

## Unary Expressions

````
UnaryExpression(allowLemma, allowLambda) =
  ( "-" UnaryExpression(allowLemma, allowLambda)
  | "!" UnaryExpression(allowLemma, allowLambda)
  | PrimaryExpression_(allowLemma, allowLambda)
  )
  
````

A ``UnaryExpression`` applies either numeric (section [#sec-numeric-types])
or logical (section [#sec-booleans]) negation to its operand.

## Primary Expressions
<!-- These are introduced for explanatory purposes as are not in the grammar. -->
````
PrimaryExpression_(allowLemma, allowLambda) =
  ( NameSegment { Suffix }
  | LambdaExpression(allowLemma)
  | MapDisplayExpr { Suffix }
  | SeqDisplayExpr { Suffix }
  | SetDisplayExpr { Suffix }
  | MultiSetExpr { Suffix }
  | EndlessExpression(allowLemma, allowLambda)
  | ConstAtomExpression { Suffix }
  )
  
````

After descending through all the binary and unary operators we arrive at
the primary expressions which are explained in subsequent sections. As
can be seen, a number of these can be followed by 0 or more ``Suffix``es
to select a component of the value.

If the `allowLambda` is false then ``LambdaExpression``s are not
recognized in this context.

## Lambda expressions
````
LambdaExpression(allowLemma) =
  ( WildIdent
  | "(" [ IdentTypeOptional { "," IdentTypeOptional } ] ")"
  )
  LambdaSpec_
  "=>" Expression(allowLemma, allowLambda: true) 
````

See section [#sec-lambda-specification] for a description of ``LambdaSpec``.

In addition to named functions, Dafny supports expressions that define
functions.  These are called _lambda (expression)s_ (some languages
know them as _anonymous functions_).  A lambda expression has the
form:
```
(\(_params_\)) \(_specification_\) => \(_body_\)
```
where `\(_params_\)` is a comma-delimited list of parameter
declarations, each of which has the form `x` or `x: T`.  The type `T`
of a parameter can be omitted when it can be inferred.  If the
identifier `x` is not needed, it can be replaced by "`_`".  If
`\(_params_\)` consists of a single parameter `x` (or `_`) without an
explicit type, then the parentheses can be dropped; for example, the
function that returns the successor of a given integer can be written
as the following lambda expression:
```
x => x + 1
```

The `\(_specification_\)` is a list of clauses `requires E` or
`reads W`, where `E` is a boolean expression and `W` is a frame
expression.

`\(_body_\)` is an expression that defines the function's return
value.  The body must be well-formed for all possible values of the
parameters that satisfy the precondition (just like the bodies of
named functions and methods).  In some cases, this means it is
necessary to write explicit `requires` and `reads` clauses.  For
example, the lambda expression
```
x requires x != 0 => 100 / x
```
would not be well-formed if the `requires` clause were omitted,
because of the possibility of division-by-zero.

In settings where functions cannot be partial and there are no
restrictions on reading the heap, the _eta expansion_ of a function
`F: T -> U` (that is, the wrapping of `F` inside a lambda expression
in such a way that the lambda expression is equivalent to `F`) would
be written `x => F(x)`.  In Dafny, eta expansion must also account for
the precondition and reads set of the function, so the eta expansion
of `F` looks like:
```
x requires F.requires(x) reads F.reads(x) => F(x)
```

## Left-Hand-Side Expressions
````
Lhs =
  ( NameSegment { Suffix }
  | ConstAtomExpression Suffix { Suffix }
  )
````

A left-hand-side expression is only used on the left hand
side of an ``UpdateStmt``.

An example of the first (`NameSegment`) form is:

```
    LibraryModule.F().x
```

An example of the second (`ConstAtomExpression`) form is:

```
    old(o.f).x
```

## Right-Hand-Side Expressions
````
Rhs =
  ( ArrayAllocation_
  | ObjectAllocation_
  | Expression(allowLemma: false, allowLambda: true)
  | HavocRhs_
  )
  { Attribute }
````

An ``Rhs`` is either array allocation, an object allocation,
an expression, or a havoc right-hand-side, optionally followed
by one or more ``Attribute``s.

Right-hand-side expressions appear in the following constructs:
``ReturnStmt``, ``YieldStmt``, ``UpdateStmt``, or ``VarDeclStatement``.
These are the only contexts in which arrays or objects may be
allocated, or in which havoc may be produced.

## Array Allocation
````
ArrayAllocation_ = "new" Type "[" Expressions "]" 
````

This allocates a new single or multi-dimensional array as explained in
section [#sec-array-types].

## Object Allocation
````
ObjectAllocation_ = "new" Type [ "(" [ Expressions ] ")" ] 
````

This allocated a new object of a class type as explained
in section [#sec-class-types].

## Havoc Right-Hand-Side
````
HavocRhs_ = "*"
````
A havoc right-hand-side produces an arbitrary value of its associated
type. To get a more constrained arbitrary value the "assign-such-that"
operator (`:|`) can be used. See section [#sec-update-and-call-statements].

## Constant Or Atomic Expressions
````
ConstAtomExpression =
  ( LiteralExpression_
  | FreshExpression_
  | OldExpression_
  | CardinalityExpression_
  | NumericConversionExpression_
  | ParensExpression
  ) 
````
A ``ConstAtomExpression`` represent either a constant of some type, or an
atomic expression. A ``ConstAtomExpression`` is never an l-value. 
## Literal Expressions
````
LiteralExpression_ = 
 ( "false" | "true" | "null" | Nat | Dec | 
   charToken | stringToken | "this") 
````
A literal expression is a boolean literal, a null object reference, 
an unsigned integer or real literal, a character or string literal,
or "this" which denote the current object in the context of
an instance method or function.

## Fresh Expressions
````
FreshExpression_ = "fresh" "(" Expression(allowLemma: true, allowLambda: true) ")" 
````

`fresh(e)` returns a boolean value that is true if
the objects referenced in expression `e` were all
freshly allocated in the current method invocation.
The argument of `fresh` must be either an object reference
or a collection of object references.

## Old Expressions
````
OldExpression_ = "old" "(" Expression(allowLemma: true, allowLambda: true) ")" 
````

An _old expression_ is used in postconditions. `old(e)` evaluates to
the value expression `e` had on entry to the current method.
Note that **old** only affects heap dereferences, like `o.f` and `a[i]`.
In particular, **old** has no effect on the value returned for local 
variables or out-parameters.

## Cardinality Expressions
````
CardinalityExpression_ = "|" Expression(allowLemma: true, allowLambda: true) "|" 
````

For a finite-collection expression `c`, `|c|` is the cardinality of `c`. For a
finite set or sequence, the cardinality is the number of elements. For
a multiset, the cardinality is the sum of the multiplicities of the
elements. For a finite map, the cardinality is the cardinality of the
domain of the map. Cardinality is not defined for infinite sets or infinite maps.
For more, see section [#sec-collection-types].

## Numeric Conversion Expressions
````
NumericConversionExpression_ = 
    ( "int" | "real" ) "(" Expression(allowLemma: true, allowLambda: true) ")" 
````
Numeric conversion expressions give the name of the target type
followed by the expression being converted in parentheses.
This production is for `int` and `real` as the target types
but this also applies more generally to other numeric types,
e.g. `newtypes`. See section [#sec-numeric-conversion-operations].

## Parenthesized Expression
````
ParensExpression =
  "(" [ Expressions ] ")" 
````
A ``ParensExpression`` is a list of zero or more expressions
enclosed in parentheses.

If there is exactly one expression enclosed then the value is just
the value of that expression.

If there are zero or more than one, the result is a `tuple` value.
See section [#sec-tuple-types].

## Sequence Display Expression
````
SeqDisplayExpr = "[" [ Expressions ] "]" 
````
A sequence display expression provide a way to constructing
a sequence with given values. For example

```
[1, 2, 3]
```
is a sequence with three elements in it.
See section [#sec-sequences] for more information on
sequences.

## Set Display Expression
````
SetDisplayExpr = [ "iset" ] "{" [ Expressions ] "}" 
````

A set display expression provides a way of constructing a set with given
elements. If the keyword `iset` is present, then a potentially infinite
set (with the finiite set of given elements) is constructed.

For example

```
{1, 2, 3}
```
is a set with three elements in it.
See section [#sec-sets] for more information on
sets.

## Multiset Display or Cast Expression
````
MultiSetExpr = 
    "multiset" 
    ( "{" [ Expressions ] "}" 
    | "(" Expression(allowLemma: true, allowLambda: true) ")" 
    ) 
````

A multiset display expression provides a way of constructing
a multiset with given elements and multiplicities. For example

```
multiset{1, 1, 2, 3}
```
is a multiset with three elements in it. The number 1 has a multiplicity of 2,
the others a multiplicity of 1.

On the other hand, a multiset cast expression converts a set or a sequence 
into a multiset as shown here:

```
var s : set<int> := {1, 2, 3};
var ms : multiset<int> := multiset(s);
ms := ms + multiset{1};
var sq : seq<int> := [1, 1, 2, 3];
var ms2 : multiset<int> := multiset(sq);
assert ms == ms2;
```

See section [#sec-multisets] for more information on
multisets.

## Map Display Expression
````
MapDisplayExpr = ("map" | "imap" ) "[" [ MapLiteralExpressions ] "]" 
MapLiteralExpressions = 
    Expression(allowLemma: true, allowLambda: true) 
    ":=" Expression(allowLemma: true, allowLambda: true) 
    { "," Expression(allowLemma: true, allowLambda: true) 
          ":=" Expression(allowLemma: true, allowLambda: true) 
    }
````

A map display expression builds a finite or potentially infinite
map from explicit ``MapLiteralExpressions``. For example:

```
var m := map[1 := "a", 2 := "b"];
ghost var im := imap[1 := "a", 2 := "b"];
```

See section [#sec-finite-and-infinite-maps] for more details on maps and imaps.

## Endless Expression
````
EndlessExpression(allowLemma, allowLambda) =
  ( IfExpression_(allowLemma, allowLambda)
  | MatchExpression(allowLemma, allowLambda)
  | QuantifierExpression(allowLemma, allowLambda)
  | SetComprehensionExpr(allowLemma, allowLambda)
  | StmtInExpr Expression(allowLemma, allowLambda)
  | LetExpr(allowLemma, allowLambda)
  | MapComprehensionExpr(allowLemma, allowLambda)
  ) 
````
<!-- Experimental - do not document.
  | NamedExpr(allowLemma, allowLambda)
-->

``EndlessExpression`` gets it name from the fact that all its alternate
productions have no terminating symbol to end them, but rather they
all end with an ``Expression`` at the end. The various
``EndlessExpression`` alternatives are described below.

## If Expression
````
IfExpression_(allowLemma, allowLambda) = 
    "if" Expression(allowLemma: true, allowLambda: true)
    "then" Expression(allowLemma: true, allowLambda: true) 
    "else" Expression(allowLemma, allowLambda) 
````

The ``IfExpression`` is a conditional expression. It first evaluates
the expression following the `if`. If it evaluates to `true` then
it evaluates the expression following the `then` and that is the
result of the expression. If it evaluates to `false` then the 
expression following the `else` is evaluated and that is the result
of the expression. It is important that only the selected expression
is evaluated as the following example shows.

```
var k := 10 / x; // error, may divide by 0.
var m := if x != 0 then 10 / x else 1; // ok, guarded
```

## Case Bindings and Patterns
````
CaseBinding_ =
  "case"
  ( Ident [ "(" [CasePattern { "," CasePattern } ] ")" ] 
  | "(" [ CasePattern { "," CasePattern } ] ")"
  )

CasePattern = 
  ( Ident "(" [ CasePattern { "," CasePattern } ] ")"
  | "(" [ CasePattern { "," Casepattern } ] ")"
  | IdentTypeOptional
  ) 
````

Case bindings and patterns are used for (possibly nested)
pattern matching on inductive or coinductive values.
The ``CaseBinding_`` construct is used in 
``CaseStatement`` and ``CaseExpression``s.
Besides its use in ``CaseBinding_``, ``CasePattern``s are used
in ``LetExpr``s and ``VarDeclStatement``s.

When matching an inductive or coinductive value in
a ``MatchStmt`` or ``MatchExpression``, there must be
a ``CaseBinding_`` for each constructor. A tuple is
considered to have a single constructor.
The ``Ident`` of the ``CaseBinding_`` must match the name
of a constructor (or in the case of a tuple, the ``Ident`` is
absent and the second alternative is chosen).
The ``CasePattern``s inside the parentheses are then 
matched against the arguments that were given to the
constructor when the value was constructed.
The number of ``CasePattern``s must match the number
of parameters to the constructor (or the arity of the
tuple).

The ``CasePattern``s may be nested. The set of non-constructor-name
identifiers contained in a ``CaseBinding_`` must be distinct.
They are bound to the corresponding values in the value being
matched.

## Match Expression

````
MatchExpression(allowLemma, allowLambda) = 
  "match" Expression(allowLemma, allowLambda)
  ( "{" { CaseExpression(allowLemma: true, allowLambda: true) } "}" 
  | { CaseExpression(allowLemma, allowLambda) } 
  ) 

CaseExpression(allowLemma, allowLambda) =
    CaseBinding_ "=>" Expression(allowLemma, allowLambda) 
````

A ``MatchExpression`` is used to conditionally evaluate and select an
expression depending on the value of an algebraic type, i.e. an inductive
type, or a co-inductive type.

The ``Expression`` following the `match` keyword is called the
_selector_. There must be a ``CaseExpression`` for each constructor of
the type of the selector. The ``Ident`` following the `case` keyword in a
``CaseExpression`` is the name of a constructor of the selector's type.
It may be absent if the expression being matched is a tuple since these
have no constructor name.

If the constructor has parameters then in the ``CaseExpression`` the
constructor name must be followed by a parenthesized list of ``CasePattern``s
with one ``CasePattern`` for each constructor parameter.

If the constructor has no parameters then the
``CaseExpression`` must not have a following ``CasePattern`` list (though
optional empty parentheses are allowed).

All of the identifiers in the ``CasePattern``s must be distinct.
If types for the identifiers are not given then types are inferred
from the types of the constructor's parameters. If types are
given then they must agree with the types of the
corresponding parameters.

A ``MatchExpression`` is evaluated by first evaluating the selector.
Then the ``CaseClause`` is selected for the constructor that was
used to construct the evaluated selector. If the constructor had
parameters then the actual values used to construct the selector 
value are bound to the identifiers in the identifier list.
The expression to the right of the `=>` in the ``CaseClause`` is then
evaluated in the environment enriched by this binding. The result
of that evaluation is the result of the ``MatchExpression``.

Note that the braces enclosing the ``CaseClause``s may be omitted.

## Quantifier Expression
````
QuantifierExpression(allowLemma, allowLambda) =
    ( "forall" | "exists" ) QuantifierDomain "::"
    Expression(allowLemma, allowLambda) 

QuantifierDomain =
  IdentTypeOptional { "," IdentTypeOptional } { Attribute } 
  [ "|" Expression(allowLemma: true, allowLambda: true) ]
````

A ``QuantifierExpression`` is a boolean expression that specifies that a
given expression (the one following the "::") is true for all (for
**forall**) or some (for **exists**) combination of values of the
quantified variables, namely those in the ``QuantifierDomain``.

Here are some examples:
```
assert forall x : nat | x <= 5 :: x * x <= 25;
(forall n :: 2 <= n ==> (exists d :: n < d < 2*n))
```

or using the Unicode symbols:

```
assert \(&forall;\) x : nat | x <= 5 \(&bull;\) x * x <= 25;
(\(&forall;\) n \(&bull;\) 2 <= n ==> (\(&exist;\) d \(&bull;\) n < d < 2*n))
```

The quantifier identifiers are _bound_ within the scope of the
expressions in the ``QuantifierExpression``.

If types are not given for the quantified identifiers, then Dafny
attempts to infer their types from the context of the expressions.
It this is not possible, the program is in error.


## Set Comprehension Expressions
````
SetComprehensionExpr(allowLemma, allowLambda) =
  [ "set" | "iset" ] 
  IdentTypeOptional { "," IdentTypeOptional } { Attribute }
  "|" Expression(allowLemma, allowLambda) 
  [ "::" Expression(allowLemma, allowLambda) ] 
````

A set comprehension expression is an expressions that yields a set
(possibly infinite if `iset` is used) that 
satisfies specified conditions. There are two basic forms.

If there is only one quantified variable, the optional ``"::" Expression`` 
need not be supplied, in which case it is as if it had been supplied
and the expression consists solely of the quantified variable.
That is,

```
set x : T | P(x)
```

is equivalent to

```
set x : T | P(x) :: x
```

For the full form

```
var S := set x1:T1, x2:T2 ... | P(x1, x2, ...) :: Q(x1, x2, ...)
```

the elements of `S` will be all values resulting from evaluation of `Q(x1, x2, ...)`
for all combinations of quantified variables `x1, x2, ...` such that
predicate `P(x1, x2, ...)` holds. For example, 

```
var S := set x:nat, y:nat | x < 2 && y < 2 :: (x, y)
```
yields `S == {(0, 0), (0, 1), (1, 0), (1,1) }`

The types on the quantified variables are optional and if not given Dafny 
will attempt to infer them from the contexts in which they are used in the
`P` or `Q` expressions.

If a finite set was specified ("set" keyword used), Dafny must be able to prove that the
result is finite otherwise the set comprehension expression will not be
accepted.

Set comprehensions involving reference types such as

```
set o: object | true
```

are allowed in ghost contexts. In particular, in ghost contexts, the
check that the result is finite should allow any set comprehension
where the bound variable is of a reference type. In non-ghost contexts,
it is not allowed, because--even though the resulting set would be
finite--it is not pleasant or practical to compute at run time.

## Statements in an Expression
````
StmtInExpr = ( AssertStmt | AssumeStmt | CalcStmt ) 
````

A ``StmtInExpr`` is a kind of statement that is allowed to 
precede an expression in order to ensure that the expression
can be evaluated without error. For example:

```
assume x != 0; 10/x
```

`Assert`, `assume` and `calc` statements can be used in this way.

## Let Expression

````
LetExpr(allowLemma, allowLambda) =
    [ "ghost" ] "var" CasePattern { "," CasePattern } 
    ( ":=" | { Attribute } ":|" )
    Expression(allowLemma: false, allowLambda: true) 
    { "," Expression(allowLemma: false, allowLambda: true) } ";" 
    Expression(allowLemma, allowLambda) 
````

A `let` expression allows binding of intermediate values to identifiers
for use in an expression. The start of the `let` expression is
signaled by the `var` keyword. They look much like a local variable
declaration except the scope of the variable only extends to the
enclosed expression.

For example:
```
var sum := x + y; sum * sum
```

In the simple case, the ``CasePattern`` is just an identifier with optional
type (which if missing is inferred from the rhs).

The more complex case allows destructuring of constructor expressions.
For example:

```
datatype Stuff = SCons(x: int, y: int) | Other
function GhostF(z: Stuff): int
  requires z.SCons?
{
  var SCons(u, v) := z; var sum := u + v; sum * sum
}
```

## Map Comprehension Expression
````
MapComprehensionExpr(allowLemma, allowLambda) = 
  ( "map" | "imap" ) IdentTypeOptional { Attribute } 
  [ "|" Expression(allowLemma: true, allowLambda: true) ] 
  "::" Expression(allowLemma, allowLambda) 
````

A ``MapComprehensionExpr`` defines a finite or infinite map value
by defining a domain (using the ``IdentTypeOptional`` and the optional
condition following the "|") and for each value in the domain,
giving the mapped value using the expression following the "::".

For example:
```
function square(x : int) : int { x * x }
method test() 
{
  var m := map x : int | 0 <= x <= 10 :: x * x;
  ghost var im := imap x : int :: x * x;
  ghost var im2 := imap x : int :: square(x);
}
```

Dafny finite maps must be finite, so the domain must be constrained to be finite.
But imaps may be infinite as the example shows. The last example shows
creation of an infinite map that gives the same results as a function.

<!-- Experimental - do not document.

## Named Expression
````
NamedExpr(allowLemma, allowLambda) =
    "label" LabelName ":" Expression(allowLemma, allowLambda) 
````

A ``NamedExpr`` is an expression that has been tagged with a name.
For example:
```
label squareit: x * x 
```

This is an experimental feature.
TODO: When is this useful. Is there any way to refer to the label?
Should we remove the description?
-->

## Name Segment
````
NameSegment = Ident [ GenericInstantiation | HashCall ] 
````

A ``NameSegment`` names a Dafny entity by giving its declared
name optionally followed by information to 
make the name more complete. For the simple case, it is
just an identifier.

If the identifier is for a generic entity, it is followed by
a ``GenericInstantiation`` which provides actual types for
the type parameters.

To reference a prefix predicate (see section [#sec-copredicates]) or
prefix lemma (see section [#sec-prefix-lemmas]), the identifier
must be the name of the copredicate or colemma and it must be
followed by a ``HashCall``.

## Hash Call
````
HashCall = "#" [ GenericInstantiation ]
  "[" Expression(allowLemma: true, allowLambda: true) "]" 
  "(" [ Expressions ] ")" 
````
A ``HashCall`` is used to call the prefix for a copredicate or colemma.
In the non-generic case, just insert `"#[k]"` before the call argument
list where k is the number of recursion levels.

In the case where the `colemma` is generic, the generic type
argument is given before. Here is an example:

```
codatatype Stream<T> = Nil | Cons(head: int, stuff: T, tail: Stream)

function append(M: Stream, N: Stream): Stream
{
  match M
  case Nil => N
  case Cons(t, s, M') => Cons(t, s, append(M', N))
}

function zeros<T>(s : T): Stream<T>
{
  Cons(0, s, zeros(s))
}

function ones<T>(s: T): Stream<T>
{
  Cons(1, s, ones(s))
}

copredicate atmost(a: Stream, b: Stream)
{
  match a
  case Nil => true
  case Cons(h,s,t) => b.Cons? && h <= b.head && atmost(t, b.tail)
}

colemma {:induction false} Theorem0<T>(s: T)
  ensures atmost(zeros(s), ones(s))
{
  // the following shows two equivalent ways to getting essentially the
  // co-inductive hypothesis
  if (*) {
    Theorem0#<T>[_k-1](s);
  } else {
    Theorem0(s);
  }
}

```

where the ``HashCall`` is `"Theorem0#<T>[_k-1](s);"`.
See sections [#sec-copredicates] and [#sec-prefix-lemmas].

## Suffix
````
Suffix =
  ( AugmentedDotSuffix_
  | DatatypeUpdateSuffix_
  | SubsequenceSuffix_
  | SlicesByLengthSuffix_
  | SequenceUpdateSuffix_
  | SelectionSuffix_
  | ArgumentListSuffix_
  ) 
````

The ``Suffix`` non-terminal describes ways of deriving a new value from 
the entity to which the suffix is appended. There are six kinds
of suffixes which are described below.

### Augmented Dot Suffix
````
AugmentedDotSuffix_ = ". " DotSuffix [ GenericInstantiation | HashCall ] 
````

An augmented dot suffix consists of a simple ``DotSuffix`` optionally 
followed by either

* a ``GenericInstantiation`` (for the case where the item
selected by the ``DotSuffix`` is generic), or
* a ``HashCall`` for the case where we want to call a prefix copredicate
  or colemma. The result is the result of calling the prefix copredicate
  or colemma.

### Datatype Update Suffix

````
DatatypeUpdateSuffix_ =
  "." "(" MemberBindingUpdate { "," MemberBindingUpdate } ")"

MemberBindingUpdate = 
  ( ident | digits ) ":=" Expression(allowLemma: true, allowLambda: true)
````

A datatype update suffix is used to produce a new datatype value
that is the same as an old datatype value except that the
value corresponding to a given destructor has the specified value.
In a ``MemberBindingUpdate``, the ``ident`` or ``digits`` is the
name of a destructor (i.e. formal parameter name) for one of the
constructors of the datatype. The expression to the right of the
":=" is the new value for that formal.

All of the destructors in a ``DatatypeUpdateSuffix_`` must be
for the same constructor, and if they do not cover all of the
destructors for that constructor then the datatype value being
updated must have a value derived from that same constructor.

Here is an example:

```
module NewSyntax {
datatype MyDataType = MyConstructor(myint:int, mybool:bool) 
                    | MyOtherConstructor(otherbool:bool) 
                    | MyNumericConstructor(42:int)

method test(datum:MyDataType, x:int) 
    returns (abc:MyDataType, def:MyDataType, ghi:MyDataType, jkl:MyDataType)
    requires datum.MyConstructor?;
    ensures abc == datum.(myint := x + 2);
    ensures def == datum.(otherbool := !datum.mybool);
    ensures ghi == datum.(myint := 2).(mybool := false);
    // Resolution error: no non_destructor in MyDataType
    //ensures jkl == datum.(non_destructor := 5);
    ensures jkl == datum.(42 := 7);
{
    abc := MyConstructor(x + 2, datum.mybool); 
    abc := datum.(myint := x + 2);
    def := MyOtherConstructor(!datum.mybool);
    ghi := MyConstructor(2, false);
    jkl := datum.(42 := 7);

    assert abc.(myint := abc.myint - 2) == datum.(myint := x);
}
}
```



### Subsequence Suffix
````
SubsequenceSuffix_ = 
  "[" [ Expression(allowLemma: true, allowLambda: true) ]
      ".." [ Expression(allowLemma: true, allowLambda: true) ]
  "]" 
````
A subsequence suffix applied to a sequence produces a new sequence whose
elements are taken from a contiguous part of the original sequence. For
example, expression `s[lo..hi]` for sequence `s`, and integer-based
numerics `lo` and `hi` satisfying `0 <= lo <= hi <= |s|`. See
section [#sec-other-sequence-expressions] for details.

### Slices By Length Suffix
````
SlicesByLengthSuffix_ = 
  "[" Expression(allowLemma: true, allowLambda: true) ":"
      [ 
        Expression(allowLemma: true, allowLambda: true)
        { ":" Expression(allowLemma: true, allowLambda: true) }
        [ ":" ]
      ]
  "]"
````

Applying a ``SlicesByLengthSuffix_`` to a sequence produces a
sequence of subsequences of the original sequence.
See section [#sec-other-sequence-expressions] for details.

### Sequence Update Suffix
````
SequenceUpdateSuffix_ =
  "[" Expression(allowLemma: true, allowLambda: true) 
      ":=" Expression(allowLemma: true, allowLambda: true) 
  "]" 
````

For a sequence `s` and expressions `i` and `v`, the expression
`s[i := v]` is the same as the sequence `s` except that at
index `i` it has value `v`.

### Selection Suffix
````
SelectionSuffix_ =
  "[" Expression(allowLemma: true, allowLambda: true) 
      { "," Expression(allowLemma: true, allowLambda: true) } 
  "]" 
````

If a ``SelectionSuffix_`` has only one expression in it, it is a
zero-based index that may be used to select a single element of a
sequence or from a single-dimensional array.

If a ``SelectionSuffix_`` has more than one expression in it, then
it is a list of indices to index into a multi-dimensional array.
The rank of the array must be the same as the number of indices.

### Argument List Suffix
````
ArgumentListSuffix_ = "(" [ Expressions ] ")" 
````

An argument list suffix is a parenthesized list of expressions that
are the arguments to pass to a method or function that is being 
called. Applying such a suffix causes the method or function
to be called and the result is the result of the call.

## Expression Lists
````
Expressions = 
    Expression(allowLemma: true, allowLambda: true) 
    { "," Expression(allowLemma: true, allowLambda: true) }
````

The ``Expressions`` non-terminal represents a list of
one or more expressions separated by a comma.

# Module Refinement
TODO: Write this section.

# Attributes
````
Attribute = "{" ":" AttributeName [ Expressions ] "}" 
````
Dafny allows many of its entities to be annotated with _Attributes_.
The grammar shows where the attribute annotations may appear.

Here is an example of an attribute from the Dafny test suite:

```
{:MyAttribute "hello", "hi" + "there", 57}
```

In general an attribute may have any name the user chooses. It may be
followed by a comma separated list of expressions. These expressions will
be resolved and type-checked in the context where the attribute appears.

## Dafny Attribute Implementation Details
In the Dafny implementation the `Attributes` type holds the name of 
the attribute, a list of ``Expression`` arguments and a link to the 
previous Attributes object for that Dafny entity. So for each
Dafny entity that has attributes we have a list of them.

Dafny stores attributes on the following kinds of entities:
Declaration (base class), ModuleDefinition, Statement,
AssignmentRhs, LocalVariable, LetExpr, ComprehensionExpr,
MaybeFreeExpression, Specification.

TODO: Dafny internals information should go into a separate
document on Dafny internals.

## Dafny Attributes
All entities that Dafny translates to Boogie have their attributes
passed on to Boogie except for the `{:axiom}` attribute (which
conflicts with Boogie usage) and the `{:trigger}` attribute which is
instead converted into a Boogie quantifier _trigger_. See Section 11 of 
[@Leino:Boogie2-RefMan].

Dafny has special processing for some attributes. For some attributes, the
setting is only looked for on the entity with the attribute. For others, we start
at the entity and if the attribute is not there, look up in the hierarchy
(enclosing class and enclosing modules). The latter case is checked by
the `ContainsBoolAtAnyLevel` method in the Dafny source. The attribute
declaration closest to the entity overrides those further away.

For attributes with a single boolean expression argument, the attribute 
with no argument is interpreted as if it were true.

The attributes that are processed specially by Dafny are described in the
following sections.

### assumption 
This attribute can only be placed on a local ghost bool
variable of a method. Its declaration cannot have a rhs, but it is
allowed to participate as the lhs of exactly one assignment of the
form: `b := b && expr;`. Such a variable declaration translates in the
Boogie output to a declaration followed by an `assume b` command. 
See [@LeinoWuestholz2015], Section 3, for example uses of the `{:assumption}`
attribute in Boogie.

### autoReq boolExpr 
For a function declaration, if this attribute is set true at the nearest
level, then its `requires` clause is strengthed sufficiently so that
it may call the functions that it calls.

For following example 
```
function f(x:int) : bool
  requires x > 3
{
  x > 7
}

// Should succeed thanks to auto_reqs
function {:autoReq} g(y:int, b:bool) : bool
{
  if b then f(y + 2) else f(2*y)
}
```
the `{:autoReq}` attribute causes Dafny to 
deduce a `requires` clause for g as if it had been
declared
```
function g(y:int, b:bool) : bool
  requires if b then y + 2 > 3 else 2 * y > 3
{
  if b then f(y + 2) else f(2*y)
}
```

### autocontracts
Dynamic frames [@Kassios:FM2006;@SmansEtAl:VeriCool;@SmansEtAl:ImplicitDynamicFrames;
@LEINO:Dafny:DynamicFrames]
are frame expressions that can vary dynamically during
program execution. AutoContracts is an experimental feature that will
fill much of the dynamic-frames boilerplate into a class.

From the user's perspective, what needs to be done is simply:

* mark the class with {:autocontracts}
* declare a function (or predicate) called Valid()


AutoContracts will then:

*  Declare:
```
   ghost var Repr: set<object>
```

* For function/predicate Valid(), insert:
```
   reads this, Repr
```
* Into body of Valid(), insert (at the beginning of the body):
```
   this in Repr && null !in Repr
```
* and also insert, for every array-valued field A declared in the class:
```
   (A != null ==> A in Repr) &&
```
* and for every field F of a class type T where T has a field called Repr, also insert:
```
   (F != null ==> F in Repr && F.Repr <= Repr && this !in Repr)
```
* Except, if A or F is declared with {:autocontracts false}, then the implication will not
be added.

* For every constructor, add:
```
   modifies this
   ensures Valid() && fresh(Repr - {this})
```
* At the end of the body of the constructor, add:
```
   Repr := {this};
   if (A != null) { Repr := Repr + {A}; }
   if (F != null) { Repr := Repr + {F} + F.Repr; }
```
* For every method, add:

```
   requires Valid()
   modifies Repr
   ensures Valid() && fresh(Repr - old(Repr))
```
* At the end of the body of the method, add:
```
   if (A != null) { Repr := Repr + {A}; }
   if (F != null) { Repr := Repr + {F} + F.Repr; }
```

### axiom
The `{:axiom}` attribute may be placed on a function or method.
It means that the post-condition may be assumed to be true 
without proof. In that case also the body of the function or 
method may be omitted.

The `{:axiom}` attribute is also used for generated `reveal_*`
lemmas as shown in Section [#sec-opaque].

### compile
The `{:compile}` attribute takes a boolean argument. It may be applied to
any top-level declaration. If that argument is false, then that declaration
will not be compiled into .Net code.

### decl
The `{:decl}` attribute may be placed on a method declaration. It
inhibits the error message that has would be given when the method has an
`ensures` clauses but no body. It has been used to declare Dafny interfaces
in the MSR IronClad and IronFleet projects. Instead the `extern` keyword
should be used (but that is soon to be replaced by the `{:extern}` attribute).

### fuel
The fuel attributes is used to specify how much "fuel" a function should have,
i.e., how many times Z3 is permitted to unfold it's definition.  The
new {:fuel} annotation can be added to the function itself, it which
case it will apply to all uses of that function, or it can overridden
within the scope of a module, function, method, iterator, calc, forall,
while, assert, or assume.  The general format is:

```
{:fuel functionName,lowFuel,highFuel}
```

When applied as an annotation to the function itself, omit
functionName.  If highFuel is omitted, it defaults to lowFuel + 1.

The default fuel setting for recursive functions is 1,2.  Setting the
fuel higher, say, to 3,4, will give more unfoldings, which may make
some proofs go through with less programmer assistance (e.g., with
fewer assert statements), but it may also increase verification time,
so use it with care.  Setting the fuel to 0,0 is similar to making the
definition opaque, except when used with all literal arguments.

### heapQuantifier
The `{:heapQuantifier}` attribute may be used on a ``QuantifierExpression``.
When it appears in a quantifier expression, it is as if a new heap-valued
quantifier variable was added to the quantification. Consider this code
that is one of the invariants of a while loop.

```
invariant forall u {:heapQuantifier} :: f(u) == u + r
```

The quantifier is translated into the following Boogie:

```
(forall q$heap#8: Heap, u#5: int ::
    {:heapQuantifier} 
    $IsGoodHeap(q$heap#8) && ($Heap == q$heap#8 || $HeapSucc($Heap, q$heap#8))
       ==> $Unbox(Apply1(TInt, TInt, f#0, q$heap#8, $Box(u#5))): int == u#5 + r#0);
```

What this is saying is that the quantified expression, `f(u) == u + r`,
which may depend on the heap, is also valid for any good heap that is either the
same as the current heap, or that is derived from it by heap update operations.

### imported
If a ``MethodDecl`` or ``FunctionDecl`` has an `{:imported}` attribute,
then it is allowed to have a empty body even though it has an **ensures**
clause. Ordinarily a body would be required in order to provide the
proof of the **ensures** clause (but the `(:axiom)` attribute also
provides this facility, so the need for `(:imported)` is not clear.)
A method or function declaration may be given the `(:imported)` attribute. This suppresses
the error message that would be given if a method or function with an `ensures` clause
does not have a body.

This seems to duplicate what `extern` and `{:decl}` do and would be a good candidate for 
deprecation.

### induction
The `{:induction}` attribute controls the application of 
proof by induction to two contexts. Given a list of
variables on which induction might be applied, the
`{:induction}` attribute selects a sub-list of those
variables (in the same order) to which to apply induction.

Dafny issue [34](https://github.com/Microsoft/dafny/issues/34) 
proposes to remove the restriction that the sub-list
be in the same order, and would apply induction in the
order given in the `{:induction}` attribute.

The two contexts are:

* A method, in which case the bound variables are all the
  in-parameters of the method.
* A quantifier expression, in which case the bound variables
  are the bound variables of the quantifier expression.

The form of the `{:induction}` attribute is one of the following:

* `{:induction}` -- apply induction to all bound variables
* `{:induction false}` -- suppress induction, that is, don't apply it to any bound variable
* `{:induction L}` where `L` is a list consisting entirely of bound variables
-- apply induction to the specified bound variables
* `{:induction X}` where `X` is anything else -- treat the same as 
{:induction}, that is, apply induction to all bound variables. For this
usage conventionally `X` is `true`.

Here is an example of using it on a quantifier expression:
```
lemma Fill_J(s: seq<int>)
  requires forall i :: 1 <= i < |s| ==> s[i-1] <= s[i]
  ensures forall i,j {:induction j} :: 0 <= i < j < |s| ==> s[i] <= s[j]
{
}
```

### layerQuantifier
When Dafny is translating a quantified expression, if it has 
a `{:layerQuantifier}` attribute an additional quantifier
variable is added to the quantifier bound variables.
This variable as the predefined _LayerType_.
A `{:layerQuantifier}` attribute may be placed on a quantifier expression.
Translation of Dafny into Boogie defines a _LayerType_ which has defined zero and
successor constructors.

The Dafny source has the comment that "if a function is recursive,
then make the reveal lemma quantifier a layerQuantifier."
And in that case it adds the attribute to the quantifier.

There is no explicit user of the `{:layerQuantifier}` attribute
in the Dafny tests. So I believe this attribute is only used
internally by Dafny and not externally.

TODO: Need more complete explanation of this attribute. 
Dafny issue [35](https://github.com/Microsoft/dafny/issues/35) tracks
further effort for this attribute.

### nativeType {#sec-nativetype}
The `{:nativeType}` attribute may only be used on a ``NewtypeDecl``
where the base type is an integral type. It can take one of the following
forms:

* `{:nativeType}` - With no parameters it has no effect and the ``NewtypeDecl`` 
have its default behavior which is to choose a native type that can hold any
value satisfying the constraints, if possible, otherwise BigInteger is used.
* `{:nativeType true}` - Also gives default ``NewtypeDecl`` behavior, 
but gives an error if base type is not integral.
* `{:nativeType false}` - Inhibits using a native type. BigInteger is used
for integral types and BitRational for real types.
* `{:nativeType "typename"}` - This form has an native integral
type name as a string literal. Acceptable values are: "byte", 
"sbyte", "ushort", "short", "uint", "int", "ulong" and "long".
An error is reported if the given data type cannot hold all the
values that satisfy the constraint.


### opaque {#sec-opaque}
Ordinarily the body of a function is transparent to its users but
sometimes it is useful to hide it. If a function `f` is given the
`{:opaque}` attribute then Dafny hides the body of the function,
so that it can only be seen within its recursive clique (if any),
or if the programmer specifically asks to see it via the `reveal_f()` lemma.

We create a lemma to allow the user to selectively reveal the function's body          
That is, given:

```
  function {:opaque} foo(x:int, y:int) : int
    requires 0 <= x < 5
    requires 0 <= y < 5
    ensures foo(x, y) < 10
  { x + y }
```

We produce:

```
  lemma {:axiom} reveal_foo()
    ensures forall x:int, y:int {:trigger foo(x,y)} ::
         0 <= x < 5 && 0 <= y < 5 ==> foo(x,y) == foo_FULL(x,y)
```

where `foo_FULL` is a copy of `foo` which does not have its body
hidden. In addition `foo_FULL` is given the 
`{:opaque_full}` and `{:auto_generated}` attributes in addition
to the `{:opaque}` attribute (which it got because it is a copy of `foo`).

### opaque_full
The `{:opaque_full}` attribute is used to mark the _full_ version
of an opaque function. See Section [#sec-opaque].

<!--
Describe this where refinement is described, as appropriate.

### prependAssertToken
This is used internally in Dafny as part of module refinement.
It is an attribute on an assert statement.
The Dafny code has the following comment:

```
// Clone the expression, but among the new assert's attributes, indicate
// that this assertion is supposed to be translated into a check.  That is,
// it is not allowed to be just assumed in the translation, despite the fact
// that the condition is inherited.
```

TODO: Decide if we want to describe this in more detail, or whether
the functionality is already adequately described where
refinement is described.
-->

### tailrecursion
This attribute is used on method declarations. It has a boolean argument.

If specified with a false value, it means the user specifically
requested no tail recursion, so none is done.

If specified with a true value, or if no argument is specified,
then tail recursive optimization will be attempted subject to 
the following conditions:

* It is an error if the method is a ghost method and tail 
recursion was explicitly requested.
* Only direct recursion is supported, not mutually recursive methods.
* If `{:tailrecursion true}` was specified but the code does not allow it,
an error message is given.

### timeLimitMultiplier
This attribute may be placed on a method or function declaration
and has an integer argument. If `{:timeLimitMultiplier X}` was 
specified a `{:timelimit Y}` attributed is passed on to Boogie
where `Y` is `X` times either the default verification time limit
for a function or method, or times the value specified by the
Boogie `timelimit` command-line option.

### trigger
Trigger attributes are used on quantifiers and comprehensions.
They are translated into Boogie triggers.

### typeQuantifier
The `{:typeQuantifier}` attribute must be used on a quantifier if it
quantifies over types.


## Boogie Attributes
Use the Boogie "/attrHelp" option to get the list of attributes
that Boogie recognizes and their meaning. Here is the output at
the time of this writing. Dafny passes attributes that have
been specified to Boogie.

```
Boogie: The following attributes are supported by this implementation.

  ---- On top-level declarations ---------------------------------------------

    {:ignore}
      Ignore the declaration (after checking for duplicate names).

    {:extern}
      If two top-level declarations introduce the same name (for example, two
      constants with the same name or two procedures with the same name), then
      Boogie usually produces an error message.  However, if at least one of
      the declarations is declared with :extern, one of the declarations is
      ignored.  If both declarations are :extern, Boogie arbitrarily chooses
      one of them to keep; otherwise, Boogie ignore the :extern declaration
      and keeps the other.

    {:checksum <string>}
      Attach a checksum to be used for verification result caching.

  ---- On implementations and procedures -------------------------------------

     {:inline N}
       Inline given procedure (can be also used on implementation).
       N should be a non-negative number and represents the inlining depth.
       With /inline:assume call is replaced with "assume false" once inlining depth is reached.
       With /inline:assert call is replaced with "assert false" once inlining depth is reached.
       With /inline:spec call is left as is once inlining depth is reached.
       With the above three options, methods with the attribute {:inline N} are not verified.
       With /inline:none the entire attribute is ignored.

     {:verify false}
       Skip verification of an implementation.

     {:vcs_max_cost N}
     {:vcs_max_splits N}
     {:vcs_max_keep_going_splits N}
       Per-implementation versions of
       /vcsMaxCost, /vcsMaxSplits and /vcsMaxKeepGoingSplits.

     {:selective_checking true}
       Turn all asserts into assumes except for the ones reachable from
       assumptions marked with the attribute {:start_checking_here}.
       Thus, "assume {:start_checking_here} something;" becomes an inverse
       of "assume false;": the first one disables all verification before
       it, and the second one disables all verification after.

     {:priority N}
       Assign a positive priority 'N' to an implementation to control the order
       in which implementations are verified (default: N = 1).

     {:id <string>}
       Assign a unique ID to an implementation to be used for verification
       result caching (default: "<impl. name>:0").

     {:timeLimit N}
       Set the time limit for a given implementation.

  ---- On functions ----------------------------------------------------------

     {:builtin "spec"}
     {:bvbuiltin "spec"}
       Rewrite the function to built-in prover function symbol 'fn'.

     {:inline}
     {:inline true}
       Expand function according to its definition before going to the prover.

     {:never_pattern true}
       Terms starting with this function symbol will never be
       automatically selected as patterns. It does not prevent them
       from being used inside the triggers, and does not affect explicit
       trigger annotations. Internally it works by adding {:nopats ...}
       annotations to quantifiers.

     {:identity}
     {:identity true}
       If the function has 1 argument and the use of it has type X->X for
       some X, then the abstract interpreter will treat the function as an
       identity function.  Note, the abstract interpreter trusts the
       attribute--it does not try to verify that the function really is an
       identity function.

  ---- On variables ----------------------------------------------------------

     {:existential true}
       Marks a global Boolean variable as existentially quantified. If
       used in combination with option /contractInfer Boogie will check
       whether there exists a Boolean assignment to the existentials
       that makes all verification conditions valid.  Without option
       /contractInfer the attribute is ignored.

  ---- On assert statements --------------------------------------------------

     {:subsumption n}
       Overrides the /subsumption command-line setting for this assertion.

     {:split_here}
       Verifies code leading to this point and code leading from this point
       to the next split_here as separate pieces.  May help with timeouts.
       May also occasionally double-report errors.

  ---- The end ---------------------------------------------------------------

```

However a scan of Boogie's sources shows it checks for the 
following attributes.

* `{:$}`
* `{:$renamed$}`
* `{:InlineAssume}`
* `{:PossiblyUnreachable}`
* `{:__dominator_enabled}`
* `{:__enabled}`
* `{:a##post##}`
* `{:absdomain}`
* `{:ah}`
* `{:assumption}`
* `{:assumption_variable_initialization}`
* `{:atomic}`
* `{:aux}`
* `{:both}`
* `{:bvbuiltin}`

* `{:captureState}`
* `{:checksum}`
* `{:constructor}`
* `{:datatype}`

# Dafny User's Guide
## Installing Dafny From Binaries
**Windows:** To install Dafny on your own machine, download Dafny.zip and
**save** it to your disk. Then, before you open or unzip it, right-click
on it and select Properties; at the bottom of the dialog, click the
Unblock button and then the OK button. Now, open Dafny.zip and copy its
contents into a directory on your machine. (You can now delete the
Dafny.zip file.)

Then:

- To run Dafny from the command line, simply run Dafny.exe from the
    `Binaries` directory.

- To install Dafny for use inside Visual Studio 2012, double-click on
    `DafnyLanguageService.vsix` to run the installer. You may first need
    to uninstall the old version of the extension from within Visual
    Studio (Tools ==\> Extensions and Updates). Then, whenever you open a
    file with the extension .dfy in Visual Studio, the Dafny mode will
    kick in. (If you don't intend to run Dafny from the command line, you
    can delete the directory into which you copied the contents of
    Dafny.zip.)

- There is also a [Dafny mode for
    Emacs](https://github.com/boogie-org/boogie-friends).

**Linux and Mac:** Make sure you have Mono version 4. Then save the
contents of the Dafny.zip for the appropriate version of your platform.
You can now run Dafny from the command line by invoking the script file
`dafny`. For an IDE, use the [Dafny mode for
Emacs](https://github.com/boogie-org/boogie-friends).

## Building Dafny from Source
The current version of the Dafny executable builds and runs with Visual Studio 2012 or later,
but the Visual Studio extensions for Dafny currently only build with Visual Studio 2012. 
So if you intend to run Dafny from within Visual Studio (using extensions that you have
built yourself), you must install Visual Studio 2012.

First, install the following external dependencies:

-   Visual Studio 2012 Ultimate

-   [Visual Studio 2012 sdk extension](https://visualstudiogallery.msdn.microsoft.com/b2fa5b3b-25eb-4a2f-80fd-59224778ea98)

-   [Code contract extension](https://visualstudiogallery.msdn.microsoft.com/1ec7db13-3363-46c9-851f-1ce455f66970)

-   [NUnit test adapter](https://visualstudiogallery.msdn.microsoft.com/6ab922d0-21c0-4f06-ab5f-4ecd1fe7175d)

-   To install lit (for test run):
    -   first, install [python](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
    -   second, install [pip](http://pip.readthedocs.org/en/stable/installing/)
    -   last, run "pip install lit" and "pip install OutputCheck"

Second, clone source code (into sibling directories)

-   [Dafny](https://github.com/Microsoft/dafny)
-   [Boogie](https://github.com/boogie-org/boogie)

Last, follow the conventions:

-   Visual Studio
    -   Set "General:Tab" to "2 2"
    -   For `"C#:Formatting:NewLines` Turn everything off except the first option.


Dafny performs its verification by translating the Dafny source into
the Boogie intermediate verification language. So Dafny references
data structures defined in the Boogie project. So the first step
is to clone and build Boogie from sources. See 
<https://github.com/boogie-org/boogie>.

Follow these steps.

Let _work_ be a working directory.

Clone Boogie using

```
cd work
git clone https://github.com/boogie-org/boogie.git
```

Build Boogie using the directions from the Boogie web site, 
which for Windows currently are:

1. Open Source\Boogie.sln in Visual Studio
2. Right click the Boogie solution in the Solution Explorer and click Enable NuGet Package Restore. You will probably get a prompt asking to confirm this. Choose Yes.
3. Click BUILD > Build Solution.

Clone Dafny using git. The Dafny directory must be a sibling
of the Boogie directory in order for it to find the Boogie files it needs.

```
cd work
git clone https://github.com/Microsoft/dafny.git
```

Download and install the Visual Studio 2012 SDK from

* <https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=30668>.

This is needed to build the Visual Studio Extension that 
runs Dafny from within Visual Studio 2012.

Build the command-line Dafny executables.
1. Open dafny\Source\Dafny.sln in Visual Studio
2. Click BUILD > Build Solution.

Build and install the Dafny Visual Studio extensions

1. Open dafny/Source/DafnyExtension.sln in Visual Studio
2. Click BUILD > Build Solution.
3. This builds DafnyLanguageService.vsix and DafnyMenu.vsix
in the dafny/Binaries directory.
4. Install these by clicking on them from Windows Explorer. When
prompted, check installing into Visual Studio 2012, and optionally
also for later versions of Visual Studio if you have installed them.

## Using Dafny From Visual Studio
To test your installation, you can open Dafny test files
from the dafny/Test subdirectory in Visual Studio 2012.
You will want to use "VIEW/Error List" to ensure that
you see any errors that Dafny detects, and 
"VIEW/Output" to see the result of any compilation.

An example of a valid Dafny test is 

```
dafny\Test\vstte2012\Tree.dfy
```

You can choose "Dafny/Compile" to compile the Dafny
program to C#. Doing that for the above test
produces `Tree.cs` and `Tree.dll` (since this test does
not have a main program).

The following file in the Dafny repository:

```
dafny\Test\dafny0\Array.dfy
```

is an example of a Dafny file with verification errors.
The source will show red squiggles or dots where there
are errors, and the Error List window will describe the
errors.

## Using Dafny From the Command Line
### Dafny Command Line Options
The command `Dafny.exe /?` gives the following description of 
options that can be passed to Dafny.

```
  ---- Dafny options ---------------------------------------------------------

  Multiple .dfy files supplied on the command line are concatenated into one
  Dafny program.

  /dprelude:<file>
                choose Dafny prelude file
  /dprint:<file>
                print Dafny program after parsing it
                (use - as <file> to print to console)
  /printMode:<Everything|NoIncludes|NoGhost>
                NoIncludes disables printing of {:verify false} methods incorporated via the
                include mechanism, as well as datatypes and fields included from other files.
                NoGhost disables printing of functions, ghost methods, and proof statements 
                in implementation methods.  It also disables anything NoIncludes disables.
  /rprint:<file>
                print Dafny program after resolving it
                (use - as <file> to print to console)
  /dafnyVerify:<n>
                0 - stop after typechecking
                1 - continue on to translation, verification, and compilation
  /compile:<n>  0 - do not compile Dafny program
                1 (default) - upon successful verification of the Dafny
                    program, compile Dafny program to .NET assembly
                    Program.exe (if the program has a Main method) or
                    Program.dll (othewise), where Program.dfy is the name
                    of the last .dfy file on the command line
                2 - always attempt to compile Dafny program to C# program
                    out.cs, regardless of verification outcome
                3 - if there is a Main method and there are no verification
                    errors, compiles program in memory (i.e., does not write
                    an output file) and runs it
  /spillTargetCode:<n>
                0 (default) - don't write the compiled Dafny program (but
                    still compile it, if /compile indicates to do so)
                1 - write the compiled Dafny program as a .cs file
  /dafnycc      Disable features not supported by DafnyCC
  /noCheating:<n>
                0 (default) - allow assume statements and free invariants
                1 - treat all assumptions as asserts, and drop free.
  /induction:<n>
                0 - never do induction, not even when attributes request it
                1 - only apply induction when attributes request it
                2 - apply induction as requested (by attributes) and also
                    for heuristically chosen quantifiers
                3 (default) - apply induction as requested, and for
                    heuristically chosen quantifiers and ghost methods
  /inductionHeuristic:<n>
                0 - least discriminating induction heuristic (that is, lean
                    toward applying induction more often)
                1,2,3,4,5 - levels in between, ordered as follows as far as
                    how discriminating they are:  0 < 1 < 2 < (3,4) < 5 < 6
                6 (default) - most discriminating
  /noIncludes   Ignore include directives
  /noNLarith    Reduce Z3's knowledge of non-linear arithmetic (*,/,%).
                Results in more manual work, but also produces more predictable behavior.
  /autoReqPrint:<file>
                Print out requirements that were automatically generated by autoReq.
  /noAutoReq    Ignore autoReq attributes
  /allowGlobals Allow the implicit class '_default' to contain fields, instance functions,
                and instance methods.  These class members are declared at the module scope,
                outside of explicit classes.  This command-line option is provided to simply
                a transition from the behavior in the language prior to version 1.9.3, from
                which point onward all functions and methods declared at the module scope are
                implicitly static and fields declarations are not allowed at the module scope.
                The reference manual is written assuming this option is not given.


  /nologo       suppress printing of version number, copyright message
  /env:<n>      print command line arguments
                  0 - never, 1 (default) - during BPL print and prover log,
                  2 - like 1 and also to standard output
  /wait         await Enter from keyboard before terminating program
  /xml:<file>   also produce output in XML format to <file>

  /noResolve     : parse only
  /noTypecheck   : parse and resolve only

  /print:<file>  : print Boogie program after parsing it
                   (use - as <file> to print to console)

                1 (default) - pretty-print with some line breaks.
  /printWithUniqueIds : print augmented information that uniquely
                   identifies variables
  /printUnstructured : with /print option, desugars all structured statements

                print model to <file> instead of console
  /mv:<file>    Specify file where to save the model in BVD format
  /enhancedErrorMessages:<n>
                0 (default) - no enhanced error messages
                1 - Z3 error model enhanced error messages

  /printCFG:<prefix> : print control flow graph of each implementation in
                       Graphviz format to files named:

                2 - use the more advanced verification result caching
  /verifySeparately
                verify each input program separately
  /removeEmptyBlocks:<c>
                0 - do not remove empty blocks during VC generation
                1 - remove empty blocks (default)
  /coalesceBlocks:<c>
                0 = do not coalesce blocks
                1 = coalesce blocks (default)
  /vc:<variety> n = nested block (default for /prover:Simplify),
                m = nested block reach,
                b = flat block, r = flat block reach,
                s = structured, l = local,
                d = dag (default, except with /prover:Simplify)
                doomed = doomed
  /traceverify  print debug output during verification condition generation
  /subsumption:<c>
                apply subsumption to asserted conditions:
                0 - never, 1 - not for quantifiers, 2 (default) - always
  /alwaysAssumeFreeLoopInvariants
                usually, a free loop invariant (or assume
                statement in that position) is ignored in checking contexts
                (like other free things); this option includes these free
                loop invariants as assumes in both contexts
  /inline:<i>   use inlining strategy <i> for procedures with the :inline
                attribute, see /attrHelp for details:
                  none
                  assume (default)
                  assert
                  spec
  /printInlined
                print the implementation after inlining calls to
                procedures with the :inline attribute (works with /inline)
  /lazyInline:1
                Use the lazy inlining algorithm
  /stratifiedInline:1
                Use the stratified inlining algorithm
  /fixedPointEngine:<engine>
                Use the specified fixed point engine for inference
  /recursionBound:<n>
                Set the recursion bound for stratified inlining to
                be n (default 500)
  /inferLeastForUnsat:<str>
                Infer the least number of constants (whose names
                are prefixed by <str>) that need to be set to
                true for the program to be correct. This turns
                on stratified inlining.
  /smoke        Soundness Smoke Test: try to stick assert false; in some
                places in the BPL and see if we can still prove it
  /smokeTimeout:<n>
                Timeout, in seconds, for a single theorem prover
                invocation during smoke test, defaults to 10.
  /causalImplies
                Translate Boogie's A ==> B into prover's A ==> A && B.
  /typeEncoding:<m>
                how to encode types when sending VC to theorem prover

                   p = predicates (default)
                   a = arguments
                   m = monomorphic
  /monomorphize   
                Do not abstract map types in the encoding (this is an
                experimental feature that will not do the right thing if
                the program uses polymorphism)
  /reflectAdd   In the VC, generate an auxiliary symbol, elsewhere defined
                to be +, instead of +.

  ---- Verification-condition splitting --------------------------------------

  /vcsMaxCost:<f>
                VC will not be split unless the cost of a VC exceeds this
                number, defaults to 2000.0. This does NOT apply in the
                keep-going mode after first round of splitting.
  /vcsMaxSplits:<n>
                Maximal number of VC generated per method. In keep
                going mode only applies to the first round.
                Defaults to 1.
  /vcsMaxKeepGoingSplits:<n>
                If set to more than 1, activates the keep
                going mode, where after the first round of splitting,
                VCs that timed out are split into <n> pieces and retried
                until we succeed proving them, or there is only one
                assertion on a single path and it timeouts (in which
                case error is reported for that assertion).
                Defaults to 1.
  /vcsKeepGoingTimeout:<n>
                Timeout in seconds for a single theorem prover
                invocation in keep going mode, except for the final
                single-assertion case. Defaults to 1s.
  /vcsFinalAssertTimeout:<n>
                Timeout in seconds for the single last
                assertion in the keep going mode. Defaults to 30s.
  /vcsPathJoinMult:<f>
                If more than one path join at a block, by how much
                multiply the number of paths in that block, to accomodate
                for the fact that the prover will learn something on one
                paths, before proceeding to another. Defaults to 0.8.
  /vcsPathCostMult:<f1>
  /vcsAssumeMult:<f2>
                The cost of a block is
                    (<assert-cost> + <f2>*<assume-cost>) * 
                    (1.0 + <f1>*<entering-paths>)
                <f1> defaults to 1.0, <f2> defaults to 0.01.
                The cost of a single assertion or assumption is
                currently always 1.0.
  /vcsPathSplitMult:<f>
                If the best path split of a VC of cost A is into
                VCs of cost B and C, then the split is applied if
                A >= <f>*(B+C), otherwise assertion splitting will be
                applied. Defaults to 0.5 (always do path splitting if
                possible), set to more to do less path splitting
                and more assertion splitting.
  /vcsDumpSplits
                For split #n dump split.n.dot and split.n.bpl.
                Warning: Affects error reporting.
  /vcsCores:<n>
                Try to verify <n> VCs at once. Defaults to 1.
  /vcsLoad:<f>  Sets vcsCores to the machine's ProcessorCount * f,
                rounded to the nearest integer (where 0.0 <= f <= 3.0),
                but never to less than 1.

  ---- Prover options --------------------------------------------------------

  /errorLimit:<num>
                Limit the number of errors produced for each procedure
                (default is 5, some provers may support only 1)
  /timeLimit:<num>
                Limit the number of seconds spent trying to verify
                each procedure
  /errorTrace:<n>
                0 - no Trace labels in the error output,
                1 (default) - include useful Trace labels in error output,
                2 - include all Trace labels in the error output
  /vcBrackets:<b>
                bracket odd-charactered identifier names with |'s.  <b> is:
                   0 - no (default with non-/prover:Simplify),
                   1 - yes (default with /prover:Simplify)
  /prover:<tp>  use theorem prover <tp>, where <tp> is either the name of
                a DLL containing the prover interface located in the
                Boogie directory, or a full path to a DLL containing such
                an interface. The standard interfaces shipped include:
                    SMTLib (default, uses the SMTLib2 format and calls Z3)
                    Z3 (uses Z3 with the Simplify format)
                    Simplify
                    ContractInference (uses Z3)
                    Z3api (Z3 using Managed .NET API)
  /proverOpt:KEY[=VALUE]
                Provide a prover-specific option (short form /p).
  /proverLog:<file>
                Log input for the theorem prover.  Like filenames
                supplied as arguments to other options, <file> can use the
                following macros:
                    @TIME@    expands to the current time
                    @PREFIX@  expands to the concatenation of strings given
                              by /logPrefix options
                    @FILE@    expands to the last filename specified on the
                              command line
                In addition, /proverLog can also use the macro '@PROC@',
                which causes there to be one prover log file per
                verification condition, and the macro then expands to the
                name of the procedure that the verification condition is for.
  /logPrefix:<str>
                Defines the expansion of the macro '@PREFIX@', which can
                be used in various filenames specified by other options.
  /proverLogAppend
                Append (not overwrite) the specified prover log file
  /proverWarnings
                0 (default) - don't print, 1 - print to stdout,
                2 - print to stderr
  /proverMemoryLimit:<num>
                Limit on the virtual memory for prover before
                restart in MB (default:100MB)
  /restartProver
                Restart the prover after each query
  /proverShutdownLimit<num>
                Time between closing the stream to the prover and
                killing the prover process (default: 0s)
  /platform:<ptype>,<location>
                ptype = v11,v2,cli1
                location = platform libraries directory

  Simplify specific options:
  /simplifyMatchDepth:<num>
                Set Simplify prover's matching depth limit

  Z3 specific options:
  /z3opt:<arg>  specify additional Z3 options
  /z3multipleErrors
                report multiple counterexamples for each error
  /useArrayTheory
                use Z3's native theory (as opposed to axioms).  Currently
                implies /monomorphize.
  /useSmtOutputFormat
                Z3 outputs a model in the SMTLIB2 format.
  /z3types      generate multi-sorted VC that make use of Z3 types
  /z3lets:<n>   0 - no LETs, 1 - only LET TERM, 2 - only LET FORMULA,
                3 - (default) any
  /z3exe:<path>
                path to Z3 executable

  CVC4 specific options:
  /cvc4exe:<path>
                path to CVC4 executable

```
