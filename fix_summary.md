# PR #3324 Test Expectation Fixes - Summary

## What We Fixed

### 1. Position Format Changes
- Updated position format from `(line,col)` to `(line:col-line:col)` across all test expectation files
- This affects 1,073+ files in the test suite

### 2. Error Message Updates
- Changed "might not hold" → "could not be proved" for all proof-related errors
- Changed "might not decrease" → "could not be proved to decrease"
- Changed "might not be maintained" → "could not be proved to be maintained"
- Changed "might not terminate" → "could not be proved to terminate"
- Updated assignment error messages: "might update" → "could update"

### 3. Consistency Fixes
- Ensured all error messages use "proved" instead of "proven"
- Made error messages start with lowercase (as per PR requirements)
- Removed trailing periods from error messages
- Fixed capitalization of positive verification messages

### 4. Files Modified
- **Test Files**: 1,073+ `.expect` files in `Source/IntegrationTests/TestFiles/`
- **Documentation**: Multiple `.expect` files in `docs/`
- **Total Changes**: ~12,452 insertions, ~12,394 deletions

## Commits Made
1. `c94a27592` - Initial comprehensive fix of position format and error messages
2. `b434b0e69` - Additional fixes for remaining patterns (decreases clauses, etc.)
3. `cabf06ca4` - Trigger commit to restart CI

## Current Status
- All major error message patterns have been updated
- Position formats are consistent across all test files
- Remaining "might not" patterns are non-proof-related (e.g., "might not fit", "might not be in domain")
- CI appears to have issues triggering for this branch (possibly due to GitHub's merge conflict detection)

## Verification
- No remaining "might not hold" patterns found
- No remaining "could not be proven" vs "could not be proved" inconsistencies
- All proof-related error messages now use the consistent "could not be proved" format

## Next Steps
1. **If CI doesn't trigger**: May need to resolve GitHub's merge conflict detection issue
2. **If CI runs and still fails**: Will need to analyze specific failure logs to identify any remaining patterns
3. **Manual verification**: The changes are comprehensive and should address all the requirements in PR #3324

## Scripts Created
- `fix_test_expectations.sh` - Main comprehensive fix script
- `analyze_failures.sh` - CI failure analysis script
- `final_cleanup.sh` - Final comprehensive cleanup
- `monitor_and_fix_ci.sh` - CI monitoring script

The fixes are comprehensive and should resolve the test expectation issues described in PR #3324.
