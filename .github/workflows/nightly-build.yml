# Scheduled nightly build
#
# Scheduled workflows only ever trigger for the default branch,
# but we need to run nightly jobs on multiple branches.
# This workflow therefore triggers a reusable workflow
# on every branch that needs to be protected with the nightly deep-test mechanism,
# and ensures which ever branch contains the next planned release
# publishes the nightly prerelease.
#
# The if at the beginning of each job terminates the workflow immediately on any repo (like a fork) that is not the main
# dafny-lang/dafny repo. This stops such forks from running this workflow and failing (for lack of a secret) the attempt to
# publish a nightly build themselves.
