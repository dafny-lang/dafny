  release:
    # This triggers in response to a GitHub release being published,
    # which happens to work well because we do that well after first publishing
    # to NuGet. That gives at least 10 or 15 minutes for the newly published versions
    # of these packages to be available for download here.
    #
    # Unfortunately that also means this doesn't trigger on the nightly build release,
    # since that ends up updating an existing "nightly-..." release rather than creating a new one.
    # For now that's a good thing since these jobs only test the latest actual released version,
    # but ideally we'd fix both of those issues so that we test the fully NuGet publishing
    # workflow in the nightly build.
    types: [ published ]
